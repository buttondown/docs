    "text": "Automations Automations are tools that can help you grow and tend your subscriber base—all without lifting a finger! They run behind the scenes to deploy “Welcome” emails to new subscribers, schedule follow-up surveys for existing subscribers, edit subscriber tags and metadata, and more. Read on to discover how automations can help you to streamline your Buttondown workflow. Getting Started Ready to explore the exciting world of automations? All you need is a  paid  Buttondown account. Understanding Automations There are four key components to any automation: A trigger, a filter, a time, and an action. A  trigger  sparks the start of an automated sequence. Once the automation’s set in motion, a  filter  determines if that automation meets certain requirements. If the filter’s requirements are met, the automation schedules a  time  to perform an action, whether it’s immediately following the trigger or after some time has passed. When the time is right, the automation’s end result—an  action —is performed. If we put all these pieces together, an automated sequence might look something like this. Now let’s put each of these components into practice. Using Automations Create a new automation We’ll start in the “ Automations ” tab of your Buttondown dashboard. Toggle to the “New” button to create your first automation. Don’t forget to name it! Select a trigger Next, it’s time to choose a trigger to set off the automation process. There are four possible trigger options, including: When a subscriber confirms their subscription When a subscriber becomes a paid subscriber When a subscriber clicks a link in an email When a subscriber responds to a survey Let’s go with “When a subscriber confirms their subscription” for this example. Add a filter Do you want your automation to apply to all subscribers, or only to subscribers who meet certain requirements? If it’s the former, feel free to skip over this section. If it’s the latter, then click the option to add a new filter. Filters can comb through subscriber tags, metadata, types (e.g. regular, paid, gifted, unsubscribed), or payment tiers. In this example, we’ll filter for new subscribers who found your newsletter via Linktree, as marked by the “Linktree” tag. You can add as many filters as you like, but note that any given subscriber must meet all your requirements in order for the automation to work. Schedule a time Automations can either run immediately or after a specified number of minutes, hours, days, or weeks. We’ll go with “Immediately” in this case. Choose an action We’ve been building up to this moment! Now it’s time to decide what the end result of your automation will be. You can set up your “Action” to: Send a custom, archived, or recent email Add or remove tags Add metadata Here’s an example of a custom “Welcome” email that you might send to a new subscriber. Send a test email Our automation’s almost finished! All that’s left to do is test it out. Once you click “Send test email,” you’ll receive a preview email like the one below. Preview email looking good? If so, go ahead and click “Create” to publish your automation. Take a moment to kick back, relax, and let the automation do its thing! Going Above & Beyond Schedule reminders Looking for a way to boost engagement for your newsletter? Share your archives with new subscribers by scheduling an automated email. Deploy surveys Want to know what you’re doing right—or wrong—with your newsletter? Send  surveys  to find out! You can do so by setting your automation “Action” to a custom email with a  survey code . Here's what that sample survey email might look like. Add tags and metadata Tags  and  metadata  come in handy for organizing your subscriber base. Let’s say you want to make a note that a subscriber responds to one of your surveys. You can do so by setting your automation’s trigger as “When a subscriber responds to a survey,” and your action as “Add metadata.” Pro tip: It’s best to use underscores instead of hyphens when naming your metadata keys, as hyphens may result in syntax errors down the line. Send RSS to email Want to automatically update your subscribers every time you publish a new piece of content?

    "text": "CSS Buttondown is fairly opinionated about the best emails being\nplain-text friendly and minimal, but it offers you a variety of ways\nto customize your email through HTML and CSS. What to avoid Most email clients don't support the wide variety of HTML and content that you can see on the web.\nThings like   elements, embedded videos, or custom layouts and fonts are hard if not impossible\nto replicate in the limited confines of your average inbox. This isn't a Buttondown limitation; it's a Gmail (or whomever) one. A brief (and inexhaustive) list of things that emails won't be able to handle: JavaScript or other run-time scripts . JavaScript is a programming language that makes web content interactive. It's common in websites, but the vast majority of email clients block scripts since they can hide malicious content. Avoid all JavaScript. . An   (inline frame) is an HTML element that embeds content from one website into another. Inline frames are often used to insert advertisements, video, audio, or forms in other websites. Iframes often contain scripts, so most email clients block them. embedded audio or video, such as Spotify or Bandcamp playlists . Autoplay and click-to-play media won't play in an inbox unless your subscriber's email client supports HTML5   and   tags. Only one major email client, Apple Mail, supports these tags, so it's best to avoid embedded media and consider an alternative. custom forms . Forms and interactive content is impossible in email. CSS3 . Unfortunately, the CSS standard that Gmail and other clients are working off of is fairly old. You'll want to extensively test any custom CSS you are using to make sure it plays nice with many browsers; when in doubt, default to CSS that worked in, say, 2005. Using web fonts in your email With the caveat that  many email clients do not support custom web fonts  (the main ones that do support it are Apple Mail, Outlook for Mac, and HEY), it's actually fairly straightforward to specify a custom web font! You'll need the   declarations for your font. With Google Fonts, you can do this by taking the URL that Google provides you (e.g.  ), visiting that URL in your browser (e.g.,  this URL ), and copying the entire resulting page into  Buttondown's design settings  for your newsletter: Then, under that CSS in the same box in settings, you can add the following CSS to use the font: Using fonts to customize your web presence You can customize the web CSS in  Buttondown's design settings  to use a custom font for your newsletter archives. For example, using the Montserrat font from Google Fonts: Buttondown's default CSS Here is the default CSS that Buttondown applies to your emails: Centering your emails Buttondown's emails are constrained in width and left-aligned by default. This is because I think it is readable and legible and scans easily. But if you want a center-aligned email, I won't begrudge you! It's very easy with CSS. Just apply the following rule: This will keep the text in your email left-aligned, but center the text in the browser: Customizing the Gmail icon of your email Unfortunately, this is out of my (or Buttondown)'s hands — the \"avatar\" or icon that shows up in an email in Gmail is just based on whether or not that email address is registered in Google's various systems. If you're sending from a Google-adjacent email address — say a domain registered in Google Suite, or a Gmail account directly — it should show up: otherwise, it won't. (Google is exploring support for BIMI, a protocol that allows services like Buttondown to arbitrarily provide icons: I'm monitoring these developments and will be pursuing them once they become generally available!)

    "text": "Metadata What is metadata? This is a great question! The short answer is \"structured key-value data\". As of this writing, you can only apply metadata to subscribers, meaning that you can attach any sort of key-value pairs you'd like to your subscribers. This can be things like identifying information such as first and last names, so you can apply \"mail merges\" to your newsletter; or it could be for internal use only, such as customer IDs to tie subscribers back to your web application. I'd recommend also reading up on  Stripe's explanation of metadata  — Buttondown's implementation and philosophy behind it is very similar. What constitutes valid metadata? Internally, metadata is stored as raw JSON, so you can be pretty liberal with what you place into it. (If you try and view or set metadata using the Buttondown interface, there will likely be some stringification issues — for complex use cases, it's recommended to use the API or an integration like Zapier.) Note that while you can store metadata keys with hyphens (such as  ), it is difficult to access that metadata\nwhen writing an email:   is a syntax error due to the templating language used by Buttondown. As a result, I recommend using underscores instead (such as  ). Adding metadata Interested in adding metadata to your subscribers? Learn more about doing so in the  metadata section of building your subscriber base . Searching for metadata You can search for metadata in Buttondown by using the   notation. For instance, if you want to find all subscribers with a metadata key-value pair of  , you type in  : At the moment, this does not work with more than one key-value pair;   will not do what you would like it to.

If you want to be able to completely separate out multiple verticals of a newsletter (and, say, keep track of different archives) or have two entirely different publications with disjoint subscriber bases, your best bet is to set them up as separate newsletters entirely. Thankfully, this is pretty easy! Adding another newsletter to your account Just mosey on over to the top-left corner of the page, tap your username, and then tap \"Create new newsletter\": Switching newsletters Once you've added a newsletter to your account, you don't need a new login or username or anything. Just\ntap that same dropdown you used to add a newsletter and click on a different newsletter to switch to it. FAQs If I have some subscribers in one newsletter and some more subscribers in another, how much will I be charged per month? Buttondown bills you based on your number of total  unique  subscribers across all of your newsletters. If you have 2,000 subscribers in one newsletter and 1,000 subscribers in another and they’re completely disjoint (meaning that nobody is subscribed to both), you’ll be billed as if you have 3,000 subscribers; if all of the folks in that second newsletter are subscribed to the first one, though, you’ll only be billed as if you have 2,000 subscribers.

    "text": "Paid Subscriptions Whether you’d like to set up a formal paid subscription program or a fluid pay-as-you-wish model, Buttondown offers a number of different ways to collect revenue from your subscribers—while also rewarding them with exclusive perks! Getting Started To jump-start your paid newsletter, you’ll need: A  Stripe  account. Don’t worry if you don’t have one yet—our  integration guide  will help you to get your account up and running! A  paid  Buttondown account, starting at our \" Basic \" tier. Buttondown keeps the lights on by charging for premium tools like \"Paid Subscriptions.\" This business model not only incentivizes us to create the best writing tool possible, but it also means that we’ll never need to take a cut of your hard-won newsletter earnings. Got it? Good! Now let’s dive in. Setting Up a Paid Subscription Model So you’re thinking of switching your newsletter from a free subscription model to a paid one. Here’s what you need to know about Buttondown’s default settings for paid newsletters: Paid subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of your designated billing cycle, whether that’s once a month or once a year. This spares your subscribers from having to manually renew their subscriptions—while also generating more revenue for you! If you’re a subscriber and you decide that you no longer want to receive a paid newsletter, simply click \"Unsubscribe\" as you would with any other newsletter. Pro tip: You can downgrade your subscription by unsubscribing and then re-subscribing for free. While these practices are defaults in Buttondown, you can always alter your payment settings in Stripe. Integrate Buttondown with Stripe Buttondown works hand in hand with Stripe to automate payments and taxes related to your newsletter. We’ve even built a shortcut right into the \"Paid Subscriptions\" section of your Buttondown  settings . Looking for a step-by-step guide to help you activate your Stripe account? We’ve  got you covered ! Add a paid subscription plan Once you’ve integrated your Buttondown and Stripe accounts, head back to your Buttondown settings—specifically your \"Paid Subscriptions\" section. This section may look a little different now that it’s connected to your Stripe account. For starters, a button marked \"Enable Paid Subscriptions\" should have appeared. Click that button to allow paid subscriptions. (And don’t forget to save changes!) At this point, you can also choose to prohibit free subscriptions. This means that subscribers will not be able to access your newsletter or archives without opting in to your paid subscription plan. Don’t worry—you can change this setting at any time! After you’re happy with your \"Paid Subscriptions\" settings, click the \"Add Plan\" button. You’ll be greeted by a pop-up that will prompt you to choose your subscription style, price, currency, and cadence (a.k.a. billing cycle). For a paid newsletter, let's go with the \"Fixed\" style. Alternatively, if you'd rather set up a pay-as-you-wish model, skip down to that  section  below. Create a payment link Hop back over to Stripe and toggle to your \"Payments\" page. Here, you’ll be able to create your very own payment link using one of Stripe’s many no-code, low-code, or custom checkout pages. For simplicity’s sake, let’s use the no-code checkout page.  First, make sure that your checkout \"Type\" is set to \"Products or Subscriptions.\" Then add a new \"Product\" by filling in the name, description, price, and billing cycle for your newsletter. Last, but not least, double check that your selections match your paid subscription plan settings in Buttondown. If everything looks good, go ahead and publish your payment link! Share your payment link Once you publish your payment link, you’ll have the option to share it as a URL, send it as a QR code, or configure it as a \"Subscribe\" button for your website, blog, or newsletter landing page. Time to choose your own adventure! If you prefer working with URLs, copy your payment link URL and format it as a hyperlink using either Markdown or HTML. Want to go the QR code route? Download your QR code from Stripe and insert it into your webpage as an image. Finally, if you’d like to create a \"Subscribe\" button, copy Stripe’s code snippet and paste it into your webpage. Be mindful that the code’s spacing may not carry over correctly; you may need to manually remove any erroneous line breaks. And there you have it! Choose whichever payment link adventure your heart desires. Customize your paid subscription confirmation Offer your paid subscribers a warm welcome by writing a custom confirmation email in your Buttondown \"Lifecycle Settings.\" Subscribers will receive your email when they opt in to your paid newsletter. Send your first paid email Now’s your time to shine! Send your very first paid email by toggling to the \"Recipients\" button in your Buttondown writing interface. From here, select \"Premium\" to limit your email recipients to paid subscribers. After you send your email off, it’s time to kick back, relax, and start collecting your hard-earned newsletter revenue. Offering Perks for Paid Subscribers Looking for incentives to draw in more paid subscribers? These premium features are a great way to win them over! Share your paid newsletter archive Did you know that you can reward paid subscribers by giving them VIP access to your newsletter archives? There are two ways to go about this: Using shortcode or inviting subscribers manually. If shortcode’s your style, use this code snippet to generate a unique-per-subscriber link to your newsletter archive: Buttondown automatically includes an extended version of this shortcode to the footer of your paid newsletter emails. The additional code ensures that your archives link will only appear in your emails to paid subscribers. You can always edit your footer in the \" Scaffolding \" section of your Buttondown settings. Here’s what that process looks like. And here’s how that code will translate to your email footer. If code's not your thing, we’ve got a shortcut. Start by venturing to your \"Subscribers\" page in Buttondown and clicking any given paid subscribers’ email address. Then select the \"Archives\" button from the menu that pops up. This button will generate a link that you can use to manually invite that subscriber. One last thing: No matter the method you choose to share your paid newsletter archives, the link will expire when a subscriber’s paid subscription lapses. One less thing for you to worry about! Offer free trials Want to give prospective subscribers a sneak peek of your paid content? You can do that through  Stripe  by editing an existing payment link or creating a new payment link. Either way, check the box to  \"Include a Free Trial\" in your payment link editor.  This setting will allow  all  prospective subscribers to register for a free trial. If you'd rather only offer discounted content to a select few subscribers, we recommend sending promo codes. Send promo codes The Buttondown team is happy to help you create and send manual promo codes for discount subscriptions. Reach out to us at  support@buttondown.email , and we’ll get your promo code set up ASAP. However, it’s also possible (and likely faster) to create promo codes through  Stripe . You can do that by clicking \"Allow Promotion Codes\" in the advanced settings of your payment link editor. We recommend following along with Stripe’s \" Discounts For Subscriptions \" doc for more information about creating and applying promo codes. Give gift subscriptions It’s someone’s lucky day! If you’d like to give a gift newsletter subscription to any friend, family member, or subscriber, go to your \"Subscribers\" page in Buttondown and click the three dots to the right of their email address. Then select \"Gift\" from the resulting drop-down menu. Your recipient will get a notification via email once the gift subscription goes through. Should you wish to rescind the gift subscription—yikes!—then return to the drop-down menu and click \"Ungift.\" Setting Up a Free Subscription Model With Paid Features There are several ways to earn money for your newsletter without charging paid subscriptions. Talk about the best of both worlds, right? Send both paid and free newsletters Buttondown lets you specify whether emails go to all your subscribers or just your paid subscribers. You can categorize emails as either \"Premium\" or \"Free\" by clicking the \"Recipients\" button in your Buttondown writing interface. By sending both kinds of emails, you can create a loose approximation of \"Paid\" and \"Free\" subscription tiers. Offer a pay-as-you-wish model The beauty of the pay-as-you-wish model is that it encourages subscribers to support your writing without limiting their access to your content. To set up a pay-as-you-wish model, you need to go through both Buttondown and Stripe. In Buttondown, toggle to the \"Paid Subscriptions\" section of your settings and click the \"Add Plan\" button. Here, choose a \"Pay What You Want\" subscription style. By choosing this style, you’ll have the option to leave your subscription price blank or request a minimum price for subscribers to pay each billing cycle. Next, jump over to Stripe. Here, you can create a pay-as-you-wish payment link by changing your payment link \"Type\" to \"Customers Choose What They Pay.\" You’ll also have the chance to add a suggested one-time payment amount. As always, don't forget to double check that your Stripe and Buttondown settings match before you publish your payment link! Curious to learn more about setting up and customizing your payments using a pay-as-you-wish model? We recommend Stripe’s doc on \" Letting Customers Choose What to Pay .\" ",

    "text": "RSS-to-Email If you're a blogger, podcaster, or other content creator, you probably already know that RSS is a great way to distribute your content. But did you know that RSS can also be a great way to automate your newsletter? With Buttondown's RSS automation, you can automatically send your subscribers a new email every time you publish a new blog post, podcast episode, or other piece of content. You can even schedule your emails to go out weekly or monthly, if you prefer. This is a great solution for creators who already have their content published on the web (either through a CMS like Wordpress or a static site generator such as Jekyll or Gatsby), but don't want to spend time manually creating and sending a newsletter every time they publish something new. You can create an RSS automation in  Settings > Automation . Choosing a schedule At the moment, you can choose from three different 'cadences' for your RSS automation: You can have trigger a new email every time a new item is published in your RSS feed. (Buttondown checks your RSS feed every thirty minutes, so it's not quite instantaneous.) You can trigger a new email every week, on a day and time of your choosing. You can trigger a new email every month, on a day and time of your choosing. (Note that for the weekly and monthly cadences, Buttondown's automation will only trigger if there's a new item in your RSS feed.) Choosing a behavior You can choose from two different behaviors for your RSS automation that trigger according to the above cadence: You can have Buttondown send a new email every time a new item is published in your RSS feed. You can have Buttondown create a new draft email every time a new item is published in your RSS feed. The difference between these two behaviors is that the first will send the email immediately, while the second will create a draft email that you can edit before sending. Managing your RSS automation Things happen; you might have to backfill a number of blog posts and you want to exclude them from your automation or you might want to pause your newsletter\nfor a few weeks while you're tweaking the feed. Buttondown supports two ways to manage your RSS automation: You can  pause  the automation, which will prevent any new emails from being sent or drafts from being created. Any items that are detected in your RSS feed will be ignored, and will  not  be automatically queued up for sending or drafting when you unpause the automation. You can  skip  individual items in your RSS feed. This will prevent the automation from sending or drafting an email for that item, but will not prevent it from sending or drafting emails for any other items in the feed. This concept only applies if you've set up your automation on a weekly or monthly cadence. (Of course, you can always just delete the automation and create a new one!) How Buttondown parses RSS feeds RSS is a fairly open-ended spec, and there are a number of implementations that are all correct in different ways. Below is a list of the important fields that Buttondown tries to extract\nand how it extracts them, in order: Here's a simple example of the minimum possible RSS entry that Buttondown needs in RSS 2.0: Here's a similar example, except in Atom 1.0: Building a template To populate your email with content relevant to the item in your RSS feed, you'll need to build a template. Buttondown uses  Django's templating language  to render your email. This means that you can use all of the standard Django template tags and filters. For instance, if you want to send a weekly digest of blog posts, you'd start by iterating over the list of items: Or if you chose a cadence of \"every time\" for your RSS feed, you'd just send information on the latest item: Edge cases and esoterica I'm the first to admit that there's a  lot  of esoteric features and functionality when it comes to RSS. Here's a (assuredly incomplete) list of things that Buttondown either does or doesn't support: If you've got a question that isn't covered by that list, feel free to  email me  and I'll do my best to help you out.

Read on to discover how to create, send, and analyze surveys—and learn valuable insights about your subscribers along the way! Getting Started Got a burning question that you want to ask in your next email? Here’s what you’ll need to send a survey: A paid Buttondown subscription. Visit our “ Pricing ” page to learn more about how to upgrade your account! Now let’s get you the droids—er, answers—that you’re looking for. Creating Your Survey Determine your survey's question Venture to the “ Surveys ” tab of your newsletter and click “New.” You’ll encounter a pop-up that will guide you through the process of creating your survey. Your first task? Coming up with a question to ask your subscribers. Each survey has room for one question and one question only, so make it count! However, you can always include multiple surveys in a single email if you have more than one question to ask. Assign a code to your survey Next up, devise an ID for your survey in the “Code” field using letters (A–Z) and numbers (0–9). Your subscribers won't see this code—it's just for your internal use—but we recommend making it identifiable so that you can retrieve and render your survey more easily. Provide your survey's responses The “Answers” field is where any and all possible survey responses should go. List out each of your responses (e.g. “R2-D2,” “C-3PO,” and “BB-8”) on separate lines without any punctuation. Buttondown will take care of the formatting for you! Preview your survey Get a sneak peek of your survey in the “Preview” section.  This is also a good opportunity to glance back at your “Question,” “Code,” and “Answer” fields, as once you publish your survey, these fields can’t be changed. Down the line, if you’d like to make an adjustment to your survey, feel free to reach out to us at  support@buttondown.email  for assistance. However, whether your changes are big or small, the best way to edit your survey will be to create a new survey from scratch. Copy your survey code At this point, your preview’s looking good and you’re ready to publish your survey. Before clicking “Create,” take a moment to copy your survey’s code in the “Usage” section. You’ll need this code to render your survey in your email. Each survey’s code will always follow the same format. Here’s a quick example: In this case, “ID” refers to the text you used to populate your survey's “Code” field. Here’s a more “real world” example: Once you’ve copied your code, all that’s left to do is to click “Create”! In just a few moments, your survey will be published and ready to share with your subscribers. Sending Your Survey Preview your survey in an email You’ve drafted up your email and now all it needs is the cherry on top: Your survey! Here’s where that code you copied from the “Usage” section will come in handy. Simply paste the code where you’d like your survey to appear. Your writing interface won't render your survey in its entirety, so we recommend sending an email draft in order to make sure your survey’s ship shape. (Need a refresher on sending email drafts? Our “ Getting Started ” page is the best place to go!) Here’s what your survey might look like as part of your email draft: Note that if you try to click through the survey in this draft email, the buttons won’t work. That’s totally normal! Your survey will only record responses from subscribers who receive your finished email. This ensures that your survey results are as accurate as possible—more on this later! Style your survey Feel free to customize the look and feel of your survey by modifying Buttondown’s basic HTML markup. Our standard styling is as follows: Pro tip: Buttondown automatically assigns a “survey” div class to your code, so if you’re having trouble finding your survey in your CSS, all you have to do is search for the “survey” wrapping div! Convenient, right? Send your survey If the rest of your email is all set, that means it’s time to click “Send”! (Sending your very first email with Buttondown? Our “ Getting Started ” guide will walk you through the process.) Here’s an example of what any given subscriber will see when they engage with your survey: Analyzing Your Survey Understand your survey's responses There are two things to keep in mind as you comb through your survey’s responses: Surveys are not available in the web version of your email. This ensures that responses will only come from subscribers who received the survey from you directly. Subscribers can only complete your survey once. No duplicate responses here! We put these measures in place to ensure that your survey responses are an accurate reflection of your subscriber base. With that in mind, let’s take a look at your survey’s results! Read your survey's responses Toggle to the “ Surveys ” tab of your newsletter and click on the three dots to the far right of your survey’s ID.

We recommend exporting your survey’s data as a CSV file so that you can cross-reference it with other variables like tags, metadata, and more. If you’re already in your newsletter’s “ Surveys ” tab, you can export survey data by clicking the little check mark next to your desired survey and then clicking “Export” in the upper right hand corner. Shortly after you hit the “Export” button, you’ll be prompted to download your data. Alternatively, you can navigate to the “ Exports ” section of your general settings. Click on your most recent export, and your download will begin automatically. Within a few moments, you'll have a detailed CSV file containing your subscribers’ emails and survey responses.

Buttondown’s “Teams” tool is for anyone who wants to turn their newsletter into a group project. Whether you’re looking to bring in a proofreading pro, a CSS expert, or an admin enthusiast, Buttondown makes it easy to invite friends and colleagues to join in on the fun of writing, styling, and managing your newsletter. Getting Started Here’s what you’ll need to create your team: A paid Buttondown subscription. The “Teams” tool is a paid feature—visit our  pricing page  to learn more about upgrading! A username, email address, author name, and description for your newsletter. Our “ Registration & Setup ” guide will help you get your newsletter up and running! Everybody on board? Great. Let’s get to work. Building Your Team Invite new teammates Start by scrolling to the “ Team ” section at the very bottom of your Buttondown settings. Click “Invite Colleagues” and enter your teammate’s email address. At this point, you’ll be able to determine the permissions you’ll allow your teammate to have when it comes to your subscriber base, your email archives, your administrative settings, and your CSS settings. Use the “None” button if you’d prefer to keep certain aspects of your newsletter to yourself (after all, who doesn’t love a good mystery?). If you want your teammates to be in the know, but not make any changes, then the “Read” button is for you. And last, but not least, the “Read & Write” button is for giving your teammates full access to editing, managing, or styling your newsletter. Once you’ve determined your teammate’s permissions, go ahead and click “Invite” to make it official! Confirm new teammates After you’ve invited your teammate, they’ll receive a notification email like this… Your teammate can click through the link in this notification email to accept your invitation. If they already have a Buttondown account, they’ll be directed to sign in with their username and password. If they don’t have an account, a free account will be automatically created for them. When your teammate’s all settled in, they’ll be able to dive right in to working on your newsletter. At this time, you’ll also see their status change from “Pending” to “Accepted” in the “ Team ” section of your settings. Woohoo! Your Buttondown team just got a little bit bigger. Go ahead, add as many teammates as you like—the sky’s the limit! Just note that no matter how many teammates are collaborating on your newsletter, your “Author” name will stay the same. You can always change your “Author” name in your “ General ” settings. Edit teammates' permissions We’re working on adding a way for you to edit your teammates’ permissions. In the meantime, we recommend that you revoke your teammate’s permissions and then re-invite them with updated permissions. How do you revoke your teammate’s permissions, you may ask? Read on to find out! Revoke teammates' permissions Stuff happens! If someone’s not being a team player, you can revoke their access to your newsletter. To do this, head back to the “ Team ” section of your settings, and click the three dots next to your teammate’s email. Select “Revoke,” and your teammate’s permissions will update immediately. Toggle between multiple newsletters If you’re on a team or two, you might be juggling several newsletters at once. But have no fear! Buttondown makes it easy to jump from one newsletter to another. If you'd like to switch gears, click on the newsletter name in the upper left hand corner. From here, you’ll be able to choose your own adventure—or rather, newsletter!

You might be familiar with the whole \"MorningBrew viral loop\" thing, and are interested in building that;\nyou may just be curious about who your most vocal subscribers are and you want to reward them at an ad-hoc basis. Buttondown's main goal with this\nfunctionality is to  provide you with the primitives to build a referral system  without being too opinionated about what that referral system  is . What this means is, at a high level: By default, every subscriber gets a referral code! It's a six-digit alphabetical string, like   or  . Buttondown exposes sign-up links for each referral code. These sign-up links are like your default subscribe pages & archive pages,\nbut with a small affordance letting folks know that they're being referred. If someone signs up to your newsletter based on one of these sign-up links, a \"referral\" is created. This referral is exposed in all the usual places: exports, the API, and the analytics pages. Generating referral links I'll skip to the most important part: \"how do I give people the link they care about\"? This markdown snippet sums it up: Or, if you're using a custom domain: That snippet represents a long-lasting,  unique  referral link for each subscriber you have. This means that you can put language in your\nemail (or footer, or header) along the lines of: In a bit more depth: every subscriber has a   that is retrievable using Buttondown's template language. When this is passed to the above URL,\nyour main subscribe page is displayed but with a notice that mentions that the given subscriber is referring them. If someone signs up to your newsletter from that link,\nit'll be marked that they were referred! Tracking referrals You can view the referrals for your newsletter in three places: You can view the specific referrals made by a given subscriber by viewing their  Notes . This modal contains a list of all subscribers who have been referred by that subscriber, alongside their given status & subscription date. You can view an aggregate list of all referrals made by all subscribers to your newsletter by heading over to your  Analytics page . The topline modal has a total aggregation of referrals for \nthe given date range you've selected, grouped by subscriber. You can export all of your data, which contains an itemized list of all subscriber referrals made by all subscribers to your newsletter. FAQs Why don't the links at the bottom of my emails automatically act as referrals? This is a great question and the boring answer is that I want to be careful about rolling out this functionality. \nIn due time, this will be how it works. Can subscribers change their own referral code? Not at the moment, though this too is planned functionality.

    "text": "Building Your Subscriber Base There are  three  main ways you can grow your subscriber base without writing a single line of code: sharing your Buttondown URL embedding an HTML form embedding an iFrame Sharing your Buttondown URL Embedding an HTML form Buttondown exposes a URL endpoint that you can point any sort of   tag at and get an HTML-friendly form. This is great for platforms like Wordpress or Cargo that are very HTML-friendly; additionally, you can style this form to your heart's content. Below is an example of a basic form using this endpoint: You can also add one (or more tags) to automatically apply to new subscribers by specifying the   value in your form, like the following snippet (which would tag a new subscriber with  ): Embedding an iFrame If you want a seamless, pre-styled way to include a subscription option on your site, the iFrame may be the tool for you: Adding tags to your subscribers Using query parameters If you're using Buttondown's subscribe page (e.g.  ), you can automatically add new tags to new subscribers by adding a  query parameter  to the URL, such as: This will automatically give folks who subscribe through the link a tag named  . If you want to apply multiple tags at once, you can add multiple such query parameters: Using HTML If you'd prefer to use HTML, augment your form to add an   tag with a name of  . (You can supply multiple inputs; Buttondown will apply  all  tags.) An example is below. Note that the   associated with the tag being passed over is the  name  of the tag, not the  ID ; you can in fact supply either one and Buttondown\nwill do the right thing (including automatically creating a tag with the given name if no such tag exists). Adding metadata to your subscribers On your Buttondown subscribe form Buttondown's subscription form doesn't ask for any metadata by default; it's only interested in your subscribers' email address.\n(And their payment information, if you're running a paid newsletter.) If you're interested in collecting more information, though, you can add  custom subscribe form inputs . (This is a bit of a mouthful, I know!) You can find these\nat the bottom of your  design settings page . Inputs have three attributes: A  key , which corresponds with the key that will be set in the metadata for your subscriber. A  label , which is the text that will be displayed to the user. Whether or not the metadata is  required . If the metadata is required, then the input is required to be filled out by the subscriber. Using HTML I'm a fan of showing, not telling, so I'll lead with the relevant code sample: JSFiddle The trick is to set inputs with the   of  , as you can see in the code sample above: Note that these can be freeform text inputs, like above, or   inputs if you instead want to invisibly augment your subscription forms with given metadata. (For instance, you can imagine setting metadata for everyone coming through a particular tag or webpage.) Another example playground is below: Automatically sending an email to new subscribers You can do this by going to your  settings page  and checking out the section entitled  Welcome : Dealing with spammy subscribers Chances are, this is because you're using an embedded subscription widget and you don't have subscription confirmation turned on. First off — you should turn that on! I'll be building out captcha support in the future as well but in the meantime, if you still are seeing lots of spammy subscribers  email me  and I'll take a look. Changing an existing subscriber's email address If you need to change a subscriber's address (maybe they emailed you asking you to do so; maybe you know that they're starting to use a new one) you can go into the Notes screen for that subscriber and tap their address to change it! I've recorded a video  here  showing off that process. FAQs Captcha support I am piloting a program using  https://www.hcaptcha.com/  and will be bringing it (on an opt-in basis) to GA soon! Instagram Instagram's browser is a little, uh, finicky. Take out the   attribute from the form tag and you should be good to go. Medium To embed your subscription widget in Medium, all you need to do is post the link to your newsletter (e.g.  https://buttondown.email/jmduke ) in Medium — it should automatically embed. ",

    "path": "/getting-started/getting-a-custom-domain",
    "text": "Getting a Custom Domain Why would you want a custom domain? There are two reasons you'd want a custom domain for your newsletter: To  send  from your custom domain. This means that the email Buttondown sends comes from your domain rather than Buttondown's; it improves your deliverability and means your subscribers will be looking for your email even if you end up using another newsletter service other than Buttondown. To  host  archives on your custom domain. This is useful for building a distinct brand and presence for your newsletter on the web instead of using \"buttondown.email/yourusername\". How much does a custom domain cost? The answer, as always, is \"it depends\". Domains on their own generally cost around $10—$20 annually; rare or in-demand domains can cost much, much more than that. Choosing a domain name When choosing a custom domain for your website or online project, here are a few things to consider: Choose a domain that is short, easy to remember, and relevant to your business or project. Avoid using hyphens or numbers, as these can be confusing and harder to remember. Check to see if the domain you want is available. You can do this by using a domain name registrar or checking the WHOIS database. Consider purchasing multiple variations of the domain, such as the .com, .net, and .org versions, to protect your brand and prevent others from using similar names. Be aware of any potential trademark issues. Make sure you are not using a domain that infringes on someone else's trademark or intellectual property rights. Think about the long-term. Choose a domain that you will be happy with for the foreseeable future, as it can be costly and time-consuming to switch to a new domain later on. Consider the cost of the domain. Some domains can be expensive, particularly if they are in high demand or have premium features. Make sure you are willing to invest in the domain you choose. At the end of the day, I recommend finding a domain that is  as close to  you or your newsletter's name as possible. This will make it easier for people to remember and find your newsletter, and improve the synergy between your newsletter and the domain on which its hosted. Registering your domain Once you've got a domain name (or perhaps multiple names) in mind, it's time to actually purchase it! There are a number of different services — called \"domain registrars\" — which allow you to do this. If you already have a Google account, I recommend using  Google Domains . It hooks into your existing Google account and is easy to use. If you don't have a Google account, I recommend using  Namecheap . It's cheap, easy to use, and has a good reputation. Both services will prompt you for a domain name. If your top choice is available, it will let you purchase your domain (at what is hopefully a reasonable price!) and you're set. If not, they will suggest variations on that domain that may be available (perhaps with a different 'TLD', like .net instead of .com, or with some hyphens or additional words included.) What's next? Now that you've got a custom domain, it's time to set it up with Buttondown! Read one of these articles to learn more: Sending from a custom domain Hosting on a custom domain ",

Sending from a custom domain  means setting up your DNS records so that Buttondown sends outgoing emails from your domain, improving reputation and delivery metrics. Hosting requires you sign up for  either the Standard or Professional plan ; sending does not. This is because, well, sending emails that  actually get delivered  is pretty dang important, and it's scummy to hide that behind a paywall. Can I use the same domain for hosting and sending? Unfortunately, some DNS providers will not let you set up the exact same domain or subdomain for both sending emails and as your custom archive. For these DNSes, we recommend setting up completely separate subdomains — something along the lines of the following:  for your custom newsletter domain (where folks view archives and subscribe to your newsletter)  for your custom sending domain (where outgoing emails come from) This is the best option to preserve the deliverability of your newsletter (and, frankly, most people are not particularly confused by this at all.)

    "text": "Registration and Setup Ready to dive into Buttondown? Look no further for everything you need to sign up, configure your settings, and send your first newsletter. Getting Ready Buttondown is entirely based in your browser (nifty, right?). This makes registration quick and easy—but it’ll be even quicker if you have a few things at the ready: A browser with cookies, JavaScript, and in-browser pop-ups enabled An active email address A strong password Once you’re ready to roll, you can begin by registering  here . Signing Up Choose your username First thing’s first: You’ll need to think up your username. This username is not only what you’ll use to log in—it’ll also be part of your public Buttondown URL. With this in mind, you may want to pick a username that’s memorable, identifiable, and unique to your newsletter. (Don’t worry, you can change this later if you need to.) Add your email Enter your go-to email for receiving notifications, account updates, and billing information. Later on, if you decide to send your newsletter from the Buttondown server, your subscribers won’t see the email address that you registered with. Instead, they’ll see a Buttondown email address formatted as “ username@mail.buttondown.email. ” It’ll look something like this: You also have the option to send your newsletter from a  custom domain . It’s totally up to you, but if you choose to do this, then make sure your email address matches your domain in order to avoid any delivery issues. Devise your password You know the drill—use lots of numbers, letters, and symbols. Once you’ve completed these three steps, click “Create an Account” and you’ll be well on your way. Confirm your account Keep an eye out for a confirmation email from “justin@buttondown.email. ” Then click the link in that email to make your account official! Crafting Your Newsletter's Look and Feel Fill out your general newsletter details Boom, you’re in! After perusing your administrative  settings , scroll down to the “General” section to start shaping your newsletter. With your username and email taken care of, we can move on to the fun part: Coming up with your newsletter’s name, author, description, and more. This is your time to shine—customize this section however you like! Just three quick things to note: What you put in the “Author” field will populate your newsletter’s “From” field Your newsletter “Description” can be written in Markdown, HTML, or plaintext Your time zone will be used for scheduled newsletter recommendations, as well as for timestamps in your archives When you’re done filling out the details, your “General” settings should look a little something like this: Build out your newsletter's \"Scaffolding\" Your “Header” and “Footer” will appear at the top and bottom (respectively) of every newsletter that you send. These fields can be written out in Markdown, HTML, or plaintext. In this section, you also have the option to customize each newsletter’s CSS, or style, with HTML. You can learn more about building out your newsletter’s CSS  here . Establish your newsletter's \"Branding\" Your newsletter’s branding includes its color palette, or “Tint Color,” as well as its logo, or “Icon.” Your “Tint Color” will pop up as an accent in places like hyperlinks or your “Subscribe” button. Your “Icon” will appear on top of your newsletters, in your archives, and as part of your social “Share” button. Upload a square image (ideally a PNG) with a 300 x 300 resolution for the best results. Sending Your First Newsletter Import your subscribers Already have a list of subscribers? Have no fear! You can upload that list to Buttondown as a  CSV  (or \"comma-separated values\") file. Buttondown can automatically import the following values for each of your subscribers: Email address Time joined (this can be imported in the standard “month/day/year” format) Notes (these are completely open-ended, and don’t have to follow a specific format) Tags (read more about tags  here ) Metadata (read more about metadata  here ) Let’s say you have your subscriber database loaded into a Google or Excel spreadsheet. Toggle to “File,” and select “Download.” Then select “Comma-Separated Values (.csv)” to export your CSV file. Now let’s move back to Buttondown—specifically, the “Subscribers” page. From here, click the “Import” button to upload your CSV file. Once your file uploads, you’ll be guided through a series of questions to identify the columns of your CSV file. Once you’ve completed each of the guided questions, click “Done,” and Buttondown will start importing your subscribers. Note that if you’re uploading a large quantity of subscribers, it may take a few hours to process. But when Buttondown is ready, you should see your newly imported subscribers (along with their accompanying notes, tags, metadata, and more) in the “Subscribers” page. Visit our “ Importing Your Data ” doc to learn even more about downloading CSVs and importing subscribers, as well as importing past newsletter archives. Draft your first newsletter So you’ve found yourself in the “Emails” page. You may not have any newsletters there yet, but you will soon! Click the “New” button in the upper right corner to get started. You’ll be transported to Buttondown’s intuitive writing interface, where you can easily toggle between “Preview Mode” and “Editor Mode.” \"Preview Mode\" renders your Markdown or HTML draft in a more readable format. \"Editor Mode\" provides a tool bar for formatting your text, adding links, adding images, and more. When you’re ready, jump in to code your newsletter in either Markdown or HTML. Buttondown will automatically save your progress as you go! Once you’re happy with your newsletter’s subject and body text, you’ll be ready to send a draft. Click “Send Draft” and enter your preferred email address for previewing your newsletter. Then click “Add Recipient,” and off it goes! Wait just a few moments, and your draft should pop up in your inbox with “ PREVIEW ” in the subject line. Send your first newsletter After you make any necessary edits to your draft, you’re almost ready to click “Send”—there are just a few other quick details to attend to. Here’s a checklist to make sure everything’s ship shape: Have you checked all of your links? How many subscribers are you sending your newsletter to? Will you be sending to all of your subscribers, or only those with certain  tags ? Are you ready to send this newsletter immediately, or would you rather  schedule it for later ? Once you’ve double checked all the little details, it’s time to click “Send.” You’ll see a congratulatory pop-up with buttons to share your newsletter via social media or a copy-and-paste-able URL. And, in case of emergency, you’ll also have an option to “Undo” sending your newsletter. You’ve done it! For further information about uploading images, adding custom unsubscribe links, sending out mail merges, and more, check out our detailed guide for “ Sending Your First Email .” Going Above and Beyond Schedule your newsletter You may want to schedule your newsletter to send at a specific date or time. You can do this by clicking the “Scheduling” button at the bottom of your draft. Set your target date and time, and double check your time zone before clicking “Save.” One last step: Make sure you click “Send” in the bottom right corner before exiting your draft. Buttondown will still send it at the time you specified, but it needs to get the official go-ahead from you clicking “Send”! Take a look at our “ Scheduling an Email ” doc for FAQs and further information. Build your subscriber base You’ve sent your first newsletter, and now you’re ready to cultivate your subscriber base. You can start by  sharing your Buttondown URL ,  embedding an HTML form  across your platforms, or  embedding an iFrame  on your website. Our doc on “ Building Your Subscriber Base ” is a great place to start. Organize your subscriber base Tags  can be used to sort your subscribers, as well as to send out targeted email blasts. Like tags,  metadata  can also provide additional context for subscribers. That context can come in handy if you’re searching for a specific set of subscribers. Want to learn more about tags and metadata? Our “ Building Your Subscriber Base ” doc is the best way to do so. Use a custom domain You may choose to send and archive newsletters through a custom domain in order to consolidate your brand presence. Learn more about custom domains by checking out our docs for “ Getting a Custom Domain ,” “ Hosting on a Custom Domain ,” and “ Sending From a Custom Domain .” Upgrade to a paid account Buttondown is free for your first hundred subscribers. After that, we charge a small fee to help keep the lights on. Pay a visit to our “ Billing ” doc to explore all of Buttondown’s  pricing  options.

Getting Started To set this in motion, you’ll need: An email  draft  that’s reviewed and ready to go A  subscriber base  that’s excited for new content (Need to import your subscribers? Our “ Registration & Setup ” page will walk you through it) Now we're ready to go. Configuring Your Email Determine your recipients Do you want to send your email to your entire subscriber base, or only to a specific segment of your subscriber base? If it’s the latter, this is where  tags  come in handy. Let’s say that you’ve assigned tags according to how subscribers signed up for your email, and that you only want to send this particular email to subscribers who signed up through Linktree. Click the “Tags” button at the bottom of your email, and a list of your assigned tags will appear. From here, click “Linktree,” followed by “Save.” Choose as many tags as you’d like! Your email will go out to any and all subscribers with the selected tags. Fun Fact: Even if you schedule your email to send days or weeks later, that email will also go out to any new subscribers who sign up (and are given the appropriate tags) between now and then. Set your target date and time Buttondown can schedule your email to send whenever you like—as long as it’s in the future. To set a specific date and time, click the “Scheduling” button at the bottom of your email draft. Fill in your target date and time, and double check that your time zone is correct before clicking “Save.” You’re almost there! Only one more step, which is… Don't forget to click send Make sure you click “Send” in the bottom right corner before exiting your draft. Don’t worry—your email won’t actually send until the date and time you specified in the “Scheduling” pop-up. You’ll see a congratulatory pop-up with buttons to share your email via social media or a copy-and-paste-able URL. And, in case of emergency, you’ll also have an option to “Undo” sending your email.

    "text": "Sending From a Custom Domain Unlike  hosting on a custom domain  which is largely a cosmetic\nfeature, there are significant benefits to sending your emails from a custom domain. By default, Buttondown sends your emails from its own domain and webserver. This is a good thing — it means when you are first\nstarting your newsletter you can focus on writing, editing, and growing instead of dealing with arcane DNS issues. However, as your newsletter matures it becomes a better idea to think about sending directly from your domain instead. This has a number of benefits: Your emails look more professional. Open and click rates are non-trivially improved for newsletters that are coming from, say,   instead of  . You can start accruing \"domain reputation\" for your own domain. This improves the overall engagement rate for your emails. More importantly, that domain reputation carries with you — even if you leave Buttondown for another service, so long as that service also allows you to send from a custom domain. If you're using one of the following domain registrars, Buttondown offers a step-by-step guide: DreamHost Dealing with 'softfails' due to SPF Depending on your newsletter configuration, you might have been asked to set up an  SPF entry  for your custom domain. This is a DNS record that begins with the string: However, this record can only be used once in a single domain. If you're using the same custom email domain for Buttondown and for an inbox provider such as GSuite, you need to take an extra step\nto combine the two records. Instead of having two separate records, like: and The proper solution is actually to edit the existing one into something like that references both domains: Otherwise, some mailboxes may read the GSuite one and ignore the Mailgun one (set by Buttondown), causing a softfail and thus lower deliverability. The difference between hosting domains and sending domains Hosting on a custom domain  means using a domain outside of   to host your newsletter and archives — for example,  newsletter.arcana.computer . Sending from a custom domain  means setting up your DNS records so that Buttondown sends outgoing emails from your domain, improving reputation and delivery metrics. Hosting requires you sign up for  either Standard or Professional plans ; sending does not. This is because, well, sending emails that  actually get delivered  is pretty dang important, and it's scummy to hide that behind a paywall. Can I use the same domain for hosting and sending? Unfortunately, some DNS providers will not let you set up the exact same domain or subdomain for both sending emails and as your custom archive. For these DNSes, we recommend setting up completely separate subdomains — something along the lines of the following:  for your custom newsletter domain (where folks view archives and subscribe to your newsletter)  for your custom sending domain (where outgoing emails come from) This is the best option to preserve the deliverability of your newsletter (and, frankly, most people are not particularly confused by this at all.)

    "text": "Sending Your First Email Uploading images Uploading images is easy! You can just drag and drop them into the main text area of your email; it'll be automatically uploaded to S3 and inserted into the text. Buttondown uses Amazon S3 (a fairly common file hosting platform) to safely and securely store your images. They last indefinitely by default; there's no interface to delete images that you've uploaded to Buttondown, but you can do so via the API (or email me and I can manually delete them on your behalf.) This means that even if you were to delete the email in which images are referenced, the images themselves still exist on Buttondown's servers. Custom unsubscribe links This answer assumes a baseline familiarity with Markdown. Buttondown automatically appends an unsubscribe link to the footer of all emails you send, but you may want to manually place one in your email as well (for instance, at the top of the email, if it's an infrequent newsletter). To generate the unsubscription URL, use the   shortcode. Combining this with Markdown, a link would look something like: (This link will render on draft emails, but the resultant URL won't do anything of importance. I'm working on a better solution so you can 'click through' and verify that the URL is well-formed.) Tags and segmentation Buttondown offers  tags  to do this; subscribers can have one or more tags. You can send emails including (or excluding!) certain tags, making it easy to\ntailor your newsletters' content to who's going to enjoy it the most or find it the most relevant There are many ways to apply a tag to a subscriber, once you've created them: Customizing your  subscription form Manually tagging them Setting them via the  API Mail merges A mail merge is a catch-call term for sending out emails with specific fields changed. For example, being able to send out an email that says something like: Hello, {first_name}! With \"{first_name}\" being replaced by the first name of the recipient of that email. Buttondown supports mail merges through subscriber metadata. You can set metadata for a given subscriber either via the API or manually, by going to the \"Notes\" section for a given subscriber: You can then refer to metadata (such as the metadata above) in your email by using the following variable:  . You can also conditionally show a paragraph if metadata is set using a snippet like the following: Sending emails based on an RSS feed You'll want to get set up with our  RSS automation . After sending Updating your email's slug If you update the slug of an email that's already been sent out, worry not! The old link that references an old slug will still work; Buttondown keeps track of historical slugs for each email and redirects readers who go to the old link accordingly. Updating your email's issue number Buttondown tries to be clever with determining what issue number your newsletter is on. Sometimes it is either  too  clever or not nearly clever enough, though, and you end up in a situation where your seventh issue is showing up as your eighth or vice-versa. This is particularly pernicious as a problem if you're bringing in archives from another system. You can manually edit your issue numbers by going to the  Edit Email  screen in your Archive page. The  ID  field corresponds with the issue number: In particular, Buttondown will respect your existing issue numbers and always go one greater than the largest issue number, so if you change your most recent email to be the \"right\" number everything subsequent from that should be in order. (And, of course, you can disable issue numbers altogether by signing up for either the  Standard or Professional plans .) Adding share links to your email You can add share links to your email by customizing your newsletter's footer in your  settings  page. Then, you can add custom Markdown links using some template variables that Buttondown assigns you: Interested in other social networks besides Twitter and Facebook?  Email me  and I'll add them! FAQs A warning about the in-browser preview This is a common and unfortunate question. The short answer is:  email is weird, email inboxes are weird, and there's nothing you or I or anyone can do about it.  Buttondown's markdown previewing is meant to closely resemble the inbox from a content perspective (links and HTML tags and all of those things appear as they should), but will never be able to accurate resemble the inbox from a  stylistic  perspective (things being arranged and formatted as you'd expect.) Our friends over at Litmus have a  really useful, detailed answer : Web-based email clients (such as  Outlook.com  or Gmail) will certainly perform most the tasks listed above, but they also have a larger, more difficult job. They have to prepare the HTML to be converted into HTML that's safe to show within their own email client's HTML. This is a surprisingly difficult thing to do and most web-based email clients' preprocessors will err on the side of being overly restrictive and removing anything with even the slightest potential to affect the layout of their email client. We'll cover the various mistakes made by these preprocessors a little later, but you should expect this to be the second biggest cause of headaches when designing HTML emails - the first biggest cause is still to be discussed. Why is my email all ...purple? If you're previewing multiple drafts of an email in Gmail, you might notice that the text is all purple! This isn't a Buttondown thing — this is Gmail thinking that multiple emails sent in the same day with the same subject are responses to one another, and it displays the thread of emails in a \"conversation view\". You can read about Gmail's conversation view  here : The purple colouration is a display only feature that only exists in the display where it is being seen. It is not sent in any messages and you can use Gmail's show original feature to verify that - you will need to know a little about HTML coding. The colour is applied to text that is repeated from a previous message in the current conversation and the reason it is visible to recipients is because they also are using Gmail and they also have copies of previous messages in the current conversation. What gets coloured in their conversation might be quite different from what gets coloured in yours. How do I avoid the \"Promotions\" tab in Gmail? Ah, yes. The dreaded Promotions tab. Every author wants their email to be read as much as possible, and emails that show up in the 'primary' inbox in Gmail are\ngoing to be read much more often than ones in secondary tabs like Promotions. I think the trap a lot of authors fall into is thinking that the Promotions tab is the  enemy . It's not: it's the friend of your subscribers!\nGmail is making a concerted effort to make the process of reading email better, and it's your job to make sure your email stands out. Coincidentally, the way you make sure your email shows up in the right place is also the way you make sure that your email doesn't show up in spam\n(and is read & interacted with in general): Avoid using too many links or images, giving the impression that the email is low-quality or used solely for directing readers elsewhere. Send emails that are not too short, or not too long. (500 to 750 words is a pretty good area to aim for.) Cull subscribers that aren't opening or interacting with your content. A major input into Gmail and other inbox's decisions is how often it sees\nreaders clicking, opening, and replying to emails — the higher those numbers are, the more likely it is that it's a legitimate email. Note, of course, that this is not a foolproof method. There isn't one: Gmail's various categorization schemes are a deliberate black box, but\ntime and time again the best way to land in your subscribers' primary inbox is to just produce great content.

    "text": "Using Markdown Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to add things like links, images, lists, and styles to plain text. It was created by  John Gruber  back in 2004 and has quickly become nigh-ubiquitous thanks to its simple goal: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. There's a good chance that, even if you haven't heard of Markdown, you've used it before! It powers applications like Reddit and GitHub. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g.,  this text is bold ). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, but it's very quick to learn. Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors like Microsoft Word or other WYSIWYG editors, but it shines at creating simple, elegant documents — which is what Buttondown is all about. Markdown syntax guide If you're looking for a in-depth guide for more Markdown tips and tricks, I highly recommend the unofficial but authoritative  Markdown Guide . Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine is  Python-Markdown . Some details about the gnarly implementation below:\nfeel free to ignore this unless you're a Buttondown (and/or Markdown) power user! Extensions In addition, Buttondown uses a handful of extensions: smarty , to convert ASCII characters into HTML entities tables , to allow basic tables footnotes , to allow basic footnotes. (These are rendered in your online archives using  Bigfoot.js ) fenced_code , to allow a more common approach for embedding code snippets pymdownx.tilde , for allowing of deletions and subscripts CodeHilite , for syntax highlighting of code snippets Embeds In addition to all of  those , Buttondown uses some proprietary extensions for embedding things like tweets, YouTube videos, and gifs — but none of these should affect your general rendering experience. Embeds can be invoked by putting the URL of the resource (Tweet, post, image, etc.) on its own line.  Only  the URL should be on the line. Any additional whitespace or characters will intercept the magic of embeds. Embeds support URLs from the following sources: Bandcamp Gist Giphy Instagram Spotify SoundCloud Twitter Vimeo YouTube Play around with it! Escaping If you're looking for an escape hatch out of these embeds, they only trigger on links that are on self-contained lines, like the following: So you can avoid it by simply doing something like: Tables of contents If you're interested in creating a table of contents in your Buttondown newsletter, be sure to\nuse  names  (such as  ) rather than  ids  (such as  )!

Connecting your Fathom account to Buttondown To wire up your Fathom account to your Buttondown newsletter, all you need to do is create a new site: Once you've done so, you'll receive a new embed code, as seen below: Go ahead and  email me  that \"Site ID\" (  in the above screenshot) along with your username and I can take care of the rest! Adding a Fathom goal for new subscribers Fathom has a concept of 'goals' that is roughly analogous to events or actions. To quote  their documentation : So goals are useful for things like button clicks, form submissions or the loading of very important pages, like ecommerce success pages (after someone buys your product). You can create unlimited goals in Fathom, and each goal completion counts towards your page view limits on your pricing plan. If you're using Fathom to track your Buttondown account's analytics, you likely want to track  conversion rate  — the number of folks who show up on your subscribe page that ultimately subscribe. The easiest way to do this is to create a custom goal for \"subscribing\". Once you've done so, email me with the goal ID and I can get it wired together for you! ",

If you’re in need of a website,  Framer  is a sleek, no-code tool that can help you build one. By the end of this tutorial, you’ll know how to embed a subscription form for your newsletter in Framer. Getting Started Before we get going, make sure that you have: A  Framer  site that’s up, running, and ready for new content A Buttondown account (don’t be shy,  sign up here !) Connecting Buttondown to Framer Retrieve your form Our journey begins in the “Embedding & Sharing” section of your Buttondown  settings . Select the “As a Form” tab to find HTML code for adding a subscription form. Copy this code and keep it in your back pocket—you’ll need it later! Insert an \"Embed\" block Mosey on over to your canvas in  Framer . From here, click “Insert” and scroll through the dropdown menu until you arrive at “Utility.” Then click “Embed.” Switch your \"Embed\" type to \"HTML\" Click your newly embedded block, and glance over at the properties panel that pops up. Scroll down to the “Embed” section and switch your “Embed” type to “HTML.” Copy and paste your HTML form Remember that code you put in your back pocket? Pull it back out and paste it into the HTML field. You’ve done it! Your new Buttondown form should look a little something like this. Going Above and Beyond Add subscriber tags As your subscriber base grows (congrats!), you may want to organize it by assigning tags to individual subscribers. These tags can be used to sort your subscriber base, as well as to send out targeted email blasts. You can automatically add tags to any new subscribers by modifying the HTML code you used to create your subscription form. All you have to do is add a new  input  tag that matches the following format. Here’s an example of how your HTML code might look with three new tag options. Here's what that code looks like when it's rendered. Feel free to add as many tags as your heart desires. If you’re interested in learning more about tags, check out our doc on “ Building your subscriber base .” Customize your form You may want to style your form so that it matches your website’s aesthetic—that’s all good! You can do that in Framer by referencing their “ Creating Custom Forms ” doc. ",

    "text": "Linktree Ever heard the phrase “link in bio”? Odds are that the link in question is accessible through  Linktree , a tool that compiles social media pages, websites, and (yep, you guessed it!) newsletters, all in a single shareable landing page. Follow along with this guide to learn how you can grow your Buttondown subscriber base through Linktree. Getting Started Make sure that you have: A paid  Zapier  account A  Linktree Pro  account A Buttondown newsletter ( registration 's easy, and Zapier is already included in our  standard plan ) Generating Your Webhook Create your webhook Webhooks  are useful tools that can automate workflows between two or more apps.  Zapier  relies on webhooks to create “Zaps” (which is just a fun way of saying “automated workflows”). In this guide, we’ll be using Zapier to create a webhook that takes new subscribers’ information from Linktree and adds it to your Buttondown subscriber base. Let’s get started. Once you’re logged in to your paid  Zapier  account, click “Create Zap” to begin setting up your webhook. Determine your webhook's trigger Search for “Webhooks by Zapier” and select this as your trigger app. Then scroll through the menu of possible trigger events and select “Catch Hook.” Testing Your Webhook Copy and paste your webhook URL It’s showtime! Skip down to the “Test” tab, and you should see a custom webhook URL. Copy that URL, but don’t close out of your Zapier editor just yet. Hop over to your  Linktree Pro  settings and jump to the “Mailing List Integrations” section. Once you’re there, flip the switch to add an “Email Sign-Up” field. Customize your sign-up field to your heart’s content, then click the Zapier logo listed under “Storage.” The accompanying section is where you’ll paste your webhook URL. After pasting that URL, your new sign-up field should appear on the preview of your landing page. Test your webhook's trigger Now it’s time to trigger your webhook. You’ll do this by navigating to your updated Linktree landing page and populating your new sign-up field with a test email address. This test email address must be a real email address, as Buttondown may not recognize it otherwise. When you’re back in Zapier, click “Test Trigger.” Within a moment or two, Zapier should let you know that they’ve found a request that includes your test email address. Finalizing Your Webhook Determine your webhook's action Woohoo! You’re well on your way to finalizing your webhook. Next up, you’ll determine the action that your webhook will complete after it’s triggered. Start by searching for the latest version of “Buttondown” and selecting it as your action app. Then scroll through the menu of possible action events and select “Create Subscriber.” Connect your Buttondown account At this stage, if you haven’t already integrated your Buttondown account with Zapier, you may be prompted to sign in to your Buttondown account with your API Key. You can always access your API key in the “API” section of your Buttondown  settings . Inform your webhook's action From here, you can select the data that your webhook will deliver to Buttondown. Select “Email,” but feel free to include as many other options as you’d like. Test your webhook's action This is it: The moment of truth. Click “Test Action,” and within a few seconds, Zapier should send you a result featuring your trusty test email. We’re almost there—we’ve just got one last thing to do. Pop over to your “Subscribers” page in your Buttondown  settings . You should see your test email here as well. How exciting! That means your webhook is up, running, and ready to be published. Publish your webhook You’ve done it! Click “Publish your Zap” and marvel at the wonders of automated workflows. Going the Extra Mile Add tags and metadata Webhooks can really do it all—including adding tags and metadata to new subscribers. Tags  can be used to sort your subscriber base, as well as to send out targeted email blasts. Like tags,  metadata  can also provide additional context for subscribers. That context can come in handy when you’re searching for a specific set of subscribers. So, how do we add tags and metadata to webhooks? In this case, start by scrolling down to the “Action” tab in your Zapier editor. From here, you can populate the “Tag” and “Metadata” sections. Just make sure to double check that any new tags and metadata show up when you test your webhook action! After testing your webhook's action in Zapier, your new subscriber (along with their tags and metadata) should appear in your Buttondown subscriber base. Toggle to the “Notes” for any given subscriber to manage tags, metadata, and other details. And voila! On top of sending new subscribers to Buttondown, your webhook will now also help you sort them into your subscriber base. ",

There are two ways to group subscribers in Buttondown: If you want to be able to completely separate out multiple verticals of a newsletter (and, say, keep track of different archives) or have two entirely different publications with disjoint subscriber bases, your best bet is to  set them up as separate newsletters entirely . Then you can follow the import instructions above for each one. If you want all your subscribers in one place, but you want to be able to send some messages to certain groups of subscribers, use tags and  metadata . To add list identifiers from Moosend as tags to your Moosend contact lists before importing them: Export your Moosend subscribers  here . You will have to export each list separately. When exporting your Moosend subscribers, choose “Export to Excel”.\n Open the Excel file with your preferred spreadsheet software.

A  filter , which determines whether the automation should run for the given trigger. A  timing , which determines when the automation should run. An  action , which is what the automation actually does. The universe of what an automation can do will grow over time, but these are the core building blocks from which any possible automation will be composed! Triggers Right now, there are two possible triggers: A subscriber confirming their subscription. A subscriber clicking a link in an email. Filters Right now, there are two types of filters: Filtering based on the subscriber's tags Filtering based on the subscriber's metadata Filtering based on the subscriber's URL (for click triggers) Timing Right now, there are two possible timings: Immediately After a delay (e.g. 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc.) Actions Right now, there are four possible actions: Send an 'ad-hoc' email to the subscriber Send an archived email to the subscriber Adding a tag to the subscriber Removing a tag from the subscriber Examples Let's say you want to create a drip sequence for new subscribers to your newsletter: You want to send them an email immediately after they subscribe, welcoming them to your newsletter. You want to send them an email 1 week after they subscribe, with a link to your favorite blog posts . You want to send them an email 1 month after they subscribe, with a link to ask them how they're liking the newsletter. These would be three separate automations, each with a different timing and action. Frequently asked questions What happens if I change the subject or body of an email that's part of an automation?

If so, you might find it useful to export your data from time to time, whether it’s for safekeeping or just general reference down the line. Read on to learn more about the kinds of data you can export, as well as the most convenient ways to export it.  Subscriber data Head on over to the “Subscriber” tab of your Buttondown dashboard. Then on the top right, click “Export.”  After a moment or two, you’ll find a .csv file in your downloads. This .csv file will list each subscriber’s unique ID, along with their email address and any tags or metadata.

    "path": "/odds-and-ends/glossary",
    "text": "Glossary Buttondown uses a lot of terms. Here's all of them — defined. API API stands for \"application programming interface\". It's a way for software to talk to other software. Buttondown has an API that allows you to programmatically send emails, manage subscribers, and more. Attachment An attachment is a file that you can add to an email. Buttondown supports attachments in a variety of formats, including PDFs, images, and videos. CAC CAC stands for \"customer acquisition cost\". It's a metric that measures how much it costs to acquire a new customer. CAN-SPAM Act The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that regulates commercial email. It's a federal law, and it's enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. Buttondown is compliant with the CAN-SPAM Act. CPM CPM stands for \"cost per mille\". It's a metric that measures how much it costs to reach 1,000 people with an ad. CSV CSV stands for \"comma-separated values\"; Buttondown and other tools will refer to a \"CSV file\", which is\na file that ends in   and contains data separated by commas. It looks something like this: Dedicated IP A dedicated IP is an IP address that is used exclusively by one sender. DKIM DomainKeys Identified Mail, or DKIM, is a technology used to authenticate email by verifying the sending domain and ensuring that the message has not been tampered with in transit. DKIM is also used to protect against spam by verifying that the message was sent from an authorised email server. Double opt-in Double opt-in is a process that requires a subscriber to confirm their subscription before they can receive emails from you. It's a way to ensure that subscribers are actually interested in your content. Email An 'email', to Buttondown, is anything that has a subject and a body (plus a bunch of other stuff) that gets sent out to subscribers. When Buttondown talks about \"emails\" it's referring\nto stuff you haven't sent out yet (those might also be called \"drafts\", but they're still emails!) or stuff that you've set up to send out in a week\n(might be called \"scheduled emails\"!) or even stuff that you imported from another service or tool. GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a set of laws that govern how companies can collect, store, and use personal data. Buttondown is GDPR-compliant. Hosting domain A hosting domain is a custom domain (like  ) which you use to host your Buttondown subscribe pages and/or archives. Markdown Markdown is a lightweight \"markup language\" that makes it easy to add formatting elements like images, headings, and links to plain text. Buttondown uses Markdown to let you format your emails. Metadata Metadata is an attribute shared by both emails and subscribers: it is a key-value store that lets you assign arbitrary data (like first and last names, for subscribers) to objects. Sending domain \"Sending domain\" (as opposed to \"hosting domain\", defined above) is a domain that you own and use to send emails. Single opt-in Single opt-in is a process that allows a subscriber to sign up for your list without having to confirm their subscription. SPF SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a type of email authentication that verifies the sender of an email. It does this by checking the sending server's SPF record to see if it matches the domain name in the \"From\" header of the message. If it doesn't match, then the email is likely fake and can be filtered out. SPF is also used to prevent unauthorized senders from using your domain name in their messages. Subscriber A subscriber is an individual who has signed up to receive your emails. Buttondown uses the term \"subscriber\" to refer to anyone who has signed up to receive your emails, whether they're on a free or paid plan or whether they've confirmed their subscription or not. Transactional email A transactional email is an email that is sent to a subscriber in response to an action they've taken. For example, if a subscriber signs up to your list, you might send them a welcome email. That's a transactional email. If you send an email to your subscribers every week, that's not a transactional email. Webhooks Webhooks  are useful tools that can automate workflows between two or more apps. When a webhook is triggered by a specific event in one app, it will automatically complete an action in another app. The sky’s the limit when it comes to using webhooks to automate Buttondown workflows. Whether you’re looking to sync your subscribers or contents with Notion, grow your subscriber base through  Linktree , or create a community for your subscribers on Slack, webhooks are an incredibly useful way to connect Buttondown with your other favorite apps. So, how do you create a webhook? Buttondown integrates seamlessly with  Zapier , a paid platform that guides users through the process of generating webhooks.

If you'd like to enable these pieces of functionality, you can go to your  newsletter settings page  and scroll down to \"Tracking & analytics\": Adult content policy My default stance is to support all content so long as it is not harassing, damaging, or otherwise illegal. However,  paid newsletters  are a bit of a different story. Buttondown uses  Stripe  to process payments; Stripe has some restrictions on adult content. Specifically, it prohibits: Pornography and other obscene materials (including literature, imagery and other media) depicting nudity or explicitly sexual acts; sites offering any sexually-related services such as prostitution, escorts, pay-per view, adult live chat features; sexually oriented items (e.g., adult toys); adult video stores and sexually oriented massage parlors; gentleman's clubs, topless bars, and strip clubs; sexually oriented dating services Unfortunately, that means things are out of my hands: if you want to send adult content over Buttondown you cannot use its paid subscriptions functionality. Does Buttondown offer stipends or financial assistance to writers? No. In the event that I  started  such a practice, I would publish information about what heuristic I used as well as a full list of writers receiving such assistance. But I will almost certainly never do this. It is a violation of Buttondown's core ethos, which is that Buttondown is a tool rather than an ecosystem — a piece of software, rather than a platform. It's important to me that people using Buttondown are, at the end of the day, writing  newsletters , not  Buttondowns .

That’s why we created a way for you to see all the information that you want—and nothing more—when you’re glancing at your “Email” and “Subscriber” tabs. Refining Your “Email” List View Are you in the “Email” tab of your Buttondown dashboard? Good! Now all you have to do is click the “+” button in the upper right hand corner. From there, you’ll see a drop-down menu of sample “Info” and “Events” that you can use to organize your “Email” list view. Now’s a great time to experiment with exactly what you’d like to see in your “Email” list view. Pro tip: You can use the columns to sort the emails in your list. Each of the changes you make will persist once you leave the “Email” tab as well, so there’s no need to keep resetting it. Here’s a little overview of precisely what each column contains: You can pick and choose whatever combination of “Info” and “Events” you wish. The only thing you can’t remove is the email “Subject” column. Personalizing Your “Subscriber” List View No two authors are exactly alike—and that extends to their “Subscriber” list views. To tailor your list view, simply toggle to the “+” button in the upper right hand corner of the “Subscriber” tab in your Buttondown dashboard. From there, you’ll have the opportunity to make a custom selection among the following “Info” and “Metadata” options. You can also sort your subscribers based on any column of your choosing. Note that the only required column is the “Email” column. Not seeing some of these columns listed? That’s because you might not have certain data available. For instance, if you don’t use  metadata , the “Metadata” column won’t be listed as an option—because, well, there’d be nothing to populate it with! However, if you ever do want to start using metadata to  sort your subscriber base , then the option will pop up. Going Above and Beyond You’re ready to go off and organize to your heart’s content.

If you’ve ever received an email that starts with “Dear  Your Name Here ” as opposed to “Dear Reader,” it’s likely that there was a mail merge or substitution string involved—and those mail merges and substitution strings rely on  metadata  to work properly.  Read on to learn about how you, too, can collect and use metadata to personalize your newsletter! Collecting Subscriber Names By default, Buttondown’s subscription forms only collect subscribers’ email addresses. Without any adjustments, your subscription form will look something like this. But now here's the fun part: With a few customizations, you can use Buttondown's subscription forms to ask subscribers for their names, companies, interests, or any other factoids that might be useful for your newsletter! Customize your subscription form Buttondown’s “Subscribe Form Inputs” feature is a convenient way to collect metadata from subscribers who fill out your subscription form. Start by heading to the “Subscribe Form Inputs” section of your Buttondown  settings . You’ll be prompted to provide the following values for your new form input. An input key. This key will be used to access your metadata later on, so you’ll want it to be both memorable and syntax-friendly. In this case, we’re asking for subscribers’ first names, so let’s use “first_name.” (Pro tip: It’s best to use underscores instead of hyphens when naming your keys, as hyphens may result in syntax errors down the line.) A label. This is what your subscribers will see on your form, so this value should be written in plain language. Let’s go with “First” as our label for now. A “Required” checkbox. If you mark your input as “Required,” your subscriber will need to fill it out in order to submit their response. When you put all these pieces together in your form, it'll look a little like this. Once you’re happy with your new form input, toggle over to your newsletter landing page to see the changes you’ve made. When a subscriber fills out this new form, you’ll be able to see their response in the “Metadata” section of your subscriber “Notes.” Add metadata manually Prefer to go the manual route for updating your subscribers’ metadata? Go ahead and add your input key and value in the “Metadata” section of your subscriber’s “Notes” page. Don’t forget to save your changes! Update metadata through Buttondown’s API Want to add metadata to an existing subscriber using our  API ? Copy the code below and plug in your subscriber ID (which can be found in your subscriber’s “Notes”) as well as your personal API key (which can be found in the “API” section of your Buttondown  settings ). Then add your input key and its corresponding value. Run this code, and voila! The metadata in your subscriber “Notes” should be updated and ready to go. Using Subscriber Names Send personalized emails Instead of addressing emails one at a time, you can address them automatically using Buttondown’s {{ subscriber.metadata }}  template variable . By plugging your “first_name” key into this template variable, you’ll be directing Buttondown to retrieve each subscriber’s first name for you! Paste this template into your email writing interface, then sit back and let Buttondown do the rest. After your email goes out, your personalized email greeting will look a little something like this. But wait! What if you don’t have first names for every subscriber? Then it’s time to break out our “If / Else” template. This template instructs Buttondown to add a personalized greeting if and only if your subscriber has a first name assigned to them. If a recipient doesn’t have a first name assigned to them, they’ll see a generic greeting like “Howdy!” instead. Filter your subscriber base You can leverage metadata to sort through your subscriber base—and quickly, too! Let’s say you want to find a subscriber with the first name “Pikachu.” You can narrow your search by using your input key (“first_name”) along with the value you’re looking for (“Pikachu”). If you’re running into trouble, try capitalizing your subscriber’s name in the search bar. Metadata values are case sensitive! ",

    "text": "Automating Welcome Sequences We love a warm welcome sequence here at Buttondown. What's a welcome sequence, you may ask? It's a series of automatically scheduled emails that introduces new subscribers to the wonderful world of your newsletter, all while driving engagement and boosting brand affinity. Read on to learn how to craft your welcome sequence and make your new subscribers feel right at home! Getting Started Before we get going, it might be useful to take a look at our “ Registration and Setup ” and “ Sending Your First Email ” docs (if you haven’t already, that is!). Full disclosure: We also recommend having a  paid  Buttondown account, as  automations  are a premium feature. Understanding Automations Think of  automations  as shortcuts to your ideal Buttondown workflow. Every automation is made up of  four parts : A trigger, a filter, a scheduled time, and an action. How can we leverage automations to schedule the perfect welcome sequence for new subscribers? Let’s break it down step by step. Creating a Welcome Sequence Send a \"Thank You\" Email When you get a new subscriber (yay!), it’s polite to send a little \"Thank You\" for joining your newsletter. You can create an automation by hopping over to the “Automations” tab of your Buttondown dashboard and clicking “New” in the upper right hand corner. First, come up with a name for your automation sequence. (Something simple, like “Welcome Email,” will do just fine.) Then, we’ll specify our \"Trigger\" to jump-start the automation “When a subscriber confirms their subscription.\" As for the automation’s “Filter,” let’s say we only want to send welcome emails to subscribers with a WordPress  tag ; in that case we’ll set our \"Filter\" to “Tags,” “Equals,” “WordPress.” Then it’s time to schedule our newsletter. Likely you’ll want to send this as soon as possible after your subscriber confirms their subscription, so we’ll set our \"Time\" for “Immediately.” And last, but not least, you’ll want to determine your automation's \"Action.\" This is where you’ll be able to write your own custom email.  Phew! After all that, your automation might end up looking something like this... When you’re happy with your “Welcome Email,” you can choose to send yourself a test email. When your email's good to go, click “Create” to publish your automation! Follow up (once or twice) So you’ve sent your welcome email, and now you want to make sure your new subscriber is settling in. Why not send a follow-up to engage them further? To do this, we’ll start a new automation, and keep our \"Trigger\" and \"Filter\" the same. We will, however, change our \"Time\" to “After some time has passed,” and specify that we want our next email to send one week after our subscriber confirms their subscription. We’ll also write a new custom email (but keep our other \"Action\" settings the same). But we’re not done yet! We’ll craft another follow up, this time scheduled for  two  weeks after our new subscriber confirms their subscription. Perhaps this time, you might even want to include a  survey  to get to know your subscribers’ tastes a little bit better. Pretty hard not to engage with your newsletter at this point, right? Cheers to marketing at its finest! Conclude with a call to action At this point, your subscribers are getting pretty familiar with your newsletter. But let’s round out our welcome sequence with a final call to action. To do this, we’ll follow the pattern we’ve already established by setting our \"Time\" to three weeks after our \"Trigger\" (which is still set to \"When a new subscriber confirms their subscription\"). We’ll also write a new custom email, this time to entice readers to explore your offerings  outside  your newsletter.  And viola! You’ve just created your very first welcome sequence. Pop open the champagne—you’ve earned a little celebration! 🎉 Going Above and Beyond Take a peek at your analytics  Want to see how each of the emails in your welcome sequence is performing? Head on over to the \"Automations\" section of your Buttondown dashboard. Click on the automated email you had in mind, and from there, you'll be able to see all sorts of nifty stats like your open rate, click rate, and more.  ",
