description: All Buttondown newsletters are subject to periodic auditing to ensure compliance. 
---

It's important that Buttondown makes sure all newsletters on our platform are compliant and well-behaved. Part of the process in doing so is periodic verifications and audits of accounts. If your account was disabled, it was likely due to one of the following reasons:

- **You uploaded a new list of subscribers**. We verify all new lists of subscribers to ensure they are compliant with our terms of service and that they're well-behaved.
- **We detected some unusual activity with your account**, such as an unusually high subscription/unsubscription rate or an irregular volume of emails being sent.
- **The email address associated with your user account is bouncing**. If your email address is bouncing, we'll disable your account to prevent further bounces — sending out emails from an address that can't receive emails back is a good way to get flagged as spam.
- **One or more of your subscribers has registered a complaint**. We adhere to [CFBL](/glossary-cfl) standards and have a very low tolerance for complaints: if you're sending spam, or sending a lot of [cold emails](/glossary-cold-email), your account will be disabled.
- **Your email's engagement metrics are too low**. If your email's engagement metrics are [too low](/monitoring-your-domain), we'll disable your account to prevent further bounces.

The vast majority of audits take less than a full business day to complete; we'll reach out to you if we need more information or if we need to take further action, but otherwise you'll receive an email once your account is cleared.


If you believe your account was disabled in error, please [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support).
