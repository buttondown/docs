If you have a paid newsletter, you might want to send a "teaser" version of the email to your free subscribers.

A teaser email displays an abbreviated section of a newsletter email to free subscribers, with a prompt to subscribe to continue reading. This can encourage free subscribers to upgrade to a paid subscription.

Here's how to send a teaser email:

1. Navigate to the "Emails" page of your Buttondown account and start a new email draft.
1. Insert an empty line at the point in your email where you'd like to hide the remainder of the text. 
1. Type `/paywall` and press **Enter**.
1. Everything *below* the Paywall block will only be visible to [Premium](/api-subscribers-type#premium) subscribers. [Regular](/api-subscribers-type#regular) subscribers will see only the text *above* the paywall, followed by a link to pay for a subscription.
1. Send the email to a [Public](/api-emails-type#public) audience. This way, the email will be sent to both paid and unpaid subscribersâ€”but the different types of subscribers will see different content.
