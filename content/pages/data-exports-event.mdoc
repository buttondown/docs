Perhaps you’re integrating with Buttondown’s API, or using webhooks for custom workflows—either way, you might need events data to tie everything together.

## How to export email event data
1. Start in the [events](https://buttondown.com/events) log
2. Select the event (or events) that you’d like to export
3. Click “Export” in the upper right hand corner

{% noticeInfo text="If you want to export all events, simply click the “Export” button. No need to select all!" /%}

Here's what this process looks like:
{% video file="/data-exports/data-exports_events.mp4" /%}


When your export’s completed, a .csv file will automatically download.

{% noticeInfo text="If the process is taking longer than expected, we'll send you an email with the export attached." /%}


## What's included in the export

This includes your event ID, [type](/events-and-webhooks-introduction), timestamp, and more.
