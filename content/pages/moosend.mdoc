  Buttondown makes it easy to migrate your posts, subscribers and paid subscriptions from Moosend. We'll even do the import for you!
---

Welcome to Buttondown! After you've read through our "[Getting Started](/registration-and-setup)" guide, we're here to help you with your next step: transferring your subscribers from your old email platform to Buttondown.

### Exporting your subscribers

{% noticeInfo text="As of December 2021, Moosend uses semicolons as separators when exporting CSV files. Buttondown doesn’t, so make sure to follow steps 2 and 3 so you get a comma-separated file." /%}

#### Exporting all your subscribers to a single list

Export your Moosend subscribers by following the procedure in [Moosend's documentation](https://help.moosend.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403031374354-Export-your-subscribers-as-a-CSV-file-). If you have multiple lists, you must export each one separately.

When you export your Moosend subscribers, choose "Export to Excel".

After you download the Excel file, convert it to CSV. Here are a few ways to do that:

- Open the file in Excel, select **File** > **Save As** and choose **CSV** from the "Save as type" drop-down menu.
- Many other spreadsheet editors (Google Sheets, LibreOffice Calc, and more) can do the same thing.
- There are many online file converters. [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/xlsx-to-csv), for example, seems to have a reasonable [privacy policy](https://cloudconvert.com/privacy) as of December 2021.

To learn more, read [Importing your subscribers](/importing-your-data#importing-your-subscribers).

#### Exporting multiple subscriber lists

Moosend allows multiple subscriber lists. There are two ways to group subscribers in Buttondown:

- If you want to be able to completely separate out multiple verticals of a newsletter (and, say, keep track of different archives) or have two entirely different publications with disjoint subscriber bases, your best bet is to [set them up as separate newsletters entirely](/multiple-newsletters). Then you can follow the import instructions above for each one.
- If you want all your subscribers in one place, but you want to be able to send some messages to certain groups of subscribers, use tags and [metadata](/metadata). To add list identifiers from Moosend as tags to your Moosend contact lists before importing them:

Export your Moosend subscribers by following the procedure in [Moosend's documentation](https://help.moosend.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403031374354-Export-your-subscribers-as-a-CSV-file-). You will have to export each list separately.

When exporting your Moosend subscribers, choose "Export to Excel".

To format your file:

1. Open the Excel file with your preferred spreadsheet software.
2. Add the list name to the "Tags (Default)" column:

 If you already have other tags for your subscribers, you may need to create a new column and use a formula like=concat("List_Name, ", F2) to add the list name:

3. Save the spreadsheet as a CSV file
4. Follow the steps in our [guide to importing](/importing-your-data#importing-your-subscribers) to add your subscribers to Buttondown.
5. When it asks you to assign tags, select the correct tags column.

### Importing your archives (campaigns)

{% noticeInfo text="Moosend uses the word 'campaigns' to refer to what Buttondown calls 'archives.'" /%}

As of December 2021, Moosend does not have a method for exporting campaigns. Try [contacting them](https://moosend.com/contact-us/support/) and see if they will export your past campaigns for you. After they give you access to your data, [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) and we’ll take care of importing your archives.

### You did it!

After you complete the procedures above, Buttondown begins an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. After that completes, you should be safe to disable or deactivate your Moosend account.
