Skeeters, rejoice! Buttondown lets you connect your Bluesky account to your newsletter in Buttondown. This lets you automatically cross-post your newsletter emails to Bluesky. This function is powered by our [automations](/automations-introduction) feature.

To automatically cross-post your newsletter emails to Bluesky, you have to complete two steps:

1. [Connect your Bluesky and Buttondown accounts](#setting-up-your-bluesky-integration)
1. [Posting newsletters to Bluesky](#sharing-your-newsletters-to-bluesky)

## Setting up your Bluesky integration

First, you must connect your Bluesky and Buttondown accounts. This requires two steps: 
1. Generating an app-specific password in Bluesky
1. Connecting your Bluesky account to Buttondown

### #1. Generating an app-specific password in Bluesky

Bluesky requires you to generate an [app-specific password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords) for each app/integration that you connect to your account. This is different than your _account password_.

To generate this app-specific password:
1. Log into your Bluesky account
1. Navigate to Settings → [App Passwords](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords)
1. Click **Add app password** and follow the prompts to create a new password.
1. Copy the newly generated app password and save it somewhere secure.


{% noticeWarn text="You will not be able to view the app-specific password after you dismiss the screen in Bluesky. When you are prompted to copy the app password, copy it and save it somewhere secure." /%}


### #2. Connecting your Bluesky account to Buttondown

Now you can use the app-specific password you created to connect to your Buttondown newsletter. Here's how:

1. Log into your Buttondown account
1. Navigate to **Settings** → [Integrations](https://buttondown.com/settings/integrations). 
1. Find the "Bluesky" integration option and click **Configure**. The Bluesky configuration panel opens.
1. Enter your **Bluesky username** in the appropriate field.
1. Paste your generated **App-specific password** in the appropriate field.
1. Click **Save changes**. 

{% noticeWarn text="The [app-specific password](https://bsky.app/settings/app-passwords) is NOT your Bluesky account password." /%}


## Sharing your newsletters to Bluesky

To share your newsletters to Bluesky, you can create an automation that posts your newsletters to Bluesky whenever you send them. To do this, create a new [Automation](https://buttondown.com/automations/new), or just click the Automation banner below: 

{% automation
   name="Automatically post to Bluesky"
   description="This automation will automatically post new emails onto Bluesky"
   trigger="When an email is sent"
   url="https://buttondown.com/automations/new?trigger=email.sent&action=create_bluesky_post&name=Automatically+post+to+Bluesky"
   action="Post on Bluesky" /%}

The simplest and most common use case is to create an automation that posts your newsletters to Bluesky whenever you send them. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page and click **New**. The "New automation" panel opens.
1. (Optional) Give your automation a human-readable "Name."
1. Set the **Trigger** to  [when an email is sent](/api-webhooks-event-types#email.sent).
1. Set the **Action** to [Create a Bluesky post](/automation-actions#create_bsky_post).
1. (Optional) Configure any other fields to customize the automation. If you leave these fields blank, the automation will post to your Bluesky account as soon as you send a new newsletter email.
1. Click **Save changes**. 

To enable the new automation, either click **Unpause** in the automation panel, or click to enable the automation's toggle in the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page.
