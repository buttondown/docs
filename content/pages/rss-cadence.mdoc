With Buttondown's RSS-to-email functionality, you can have Buttondown aggregate posts from your RSS feed in daily, weekly, or monthly increments, then sending one email with all those posts.

## Monthly cadence

Buttondown checks your RSS feed every hour, and when it finds new posts for the current month, it appends them onto a draft (marked with an "Automated" status).

Finally on the day you choose under "Schedule," the *previous* month's draft is finalized (and sent, if you chose this Behavior).

## Monthly cadence example

Let's say you publish posts to your RSS feed on these dates:

- January 1
- January 15
- January 31
- February 1

Throughout January, a draft will be created with the posts from January.

Once January is over, the January draft is finalized, and the February 1 post is added to a new draft for February.

Then, on the correct day in February (i.e. first Monday, or whichever is chosen under Schedule), the January email is sent out.

## Test emails with monthly cadence

When you send a test email to yourself, the behavior is a bit different:

Buttondown takes all the posts in the *current* month and compiles them into a test email, which it sends to the email address on file for your account.

This is meant more as a way to preview your template to make sure everything's working, not to emulate the usual process of compiling posts over the course of a month.

## Weekly cadence

When your automation's cadence is set to Weekly, the same logic applies, just from one *week* to the next instead of one *month* to the next.
