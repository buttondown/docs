Spammy subscribers are no good! Here are a few suggestions for dealing with them:

- If you are seeing lots of spammy subscribers, please [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) and we'll see if we can help.

## Buttondown marked a subscriber as spammy, but they're not actually spammy.

Mistakes happen, and Buttondown errs on the side of caution in order to protect your newsletter and its deliverability. If we've blocked or marked a subscriber as spammy, but they're not actually spammy, you can restore their status by marking them as OK in the top-right corner of their subscriber profile.

Additionally, if you can tell that they've been blocked because of a typo in their email address, you can unblock them by changing their email address.
