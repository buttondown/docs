  Spam happens. You can protect your Buttondown newsletter by turning on double opt-in

Spammy subscribers are no good! Here are a few suggestions for dealing with them:

- If you've got an older Buttondown account, you may not have enabled [double opt-in](/glossary-double-optin). Turn that on in the [Danger Zone](https://buttondown.com/settings/danger-zone) section of your newsletter's "Settings" page. It'll help cut down on spammy subscribers.
- We'll be building out [Captcha](/glossary-captcha) support in the future but in the meantime, if you still are seeing lots of spammy subscribers [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) and we'll see if we can help.
