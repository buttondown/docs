When your export’s completed you’ll receive a .csv file.

{% noticeInfo text="If the process is taking longer than expected, we'll send you an email with the export attached." /%}

## What's included in the export

This .csv file will list each subscriber’s unique ID, their email address, plus a lot of metadata depending on your configuration.
