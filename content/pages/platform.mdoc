Buttondown allows you to programmatically manage a platform of newsletters. This is useful if you have a product with multiple users or organizations that need to have their own newsletters: you can offload the delivery, subscriber management, spam filtering, and more to Buttondown.

There are two main ways to do this:

1. **Using OAuth and interacting with newsletters as a connected service.** In this paradigm, you delegate the task of creating, owning, and paying for the newsletter to a user; the user signs up to Buttondown, connects their account to your platform, and you can then interact with their newsletter as if it were your own.
2. **Generating newsletters and owning them as a platform.** In this paradigm, you create the newsletter and own it â€” the newsletter is fully under your control.

There's no "right answer" for which approach is better; it depends on your use case. Here's a table to help you decide:

| | Service | Platform |
|----------|------|------|
| Registration | A user manually registers with their email address. | Platform programmatically registers a user. |
| Billing | User pays for their newsletter. | Platform pays for the newsletter. |
| Dashboard | Both the user and the platform can access the dashboard. | Only the platform can access the dashboard. |

## OAuth

While we're happy to work with you, OAuth support is not currently self-serve. [Please email us](mailto:support@buttondown.email) to get started.

## Spam and KYC

Under both approaches, we treat all newsletters as subject to our [acceptable use policy](/acceptable-use-policy). All new newsletters are evaluated independently; any disablements or violations are also evaluated independently, and one bad actor does not affect the entire platform.
