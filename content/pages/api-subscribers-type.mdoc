As you'll see, most of the logic here is really to deal with the state space of paid subscriptions, and therefore might not be _super_ relevant to you.

    subgraph paid_subscriptions

      unpaid

      churned
    end

Which is why we also present this chart _without_ paid subscriptions_.

  layout: elk
  elk:
    mergeEdges: true
    nodePlacementStrategy: LINEAR_SEGMENTS

    unactivated[Unactivated] --> regular[Regular]
    regular --> unsubscribed[Unsubscribed]
    regular --> undeliverable[Undeliverable]
    regular --> complained[Complained]
```
