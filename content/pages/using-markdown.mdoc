Using Markdown is different than using a [WYSIWYG](/glossary-wysiwyg) editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different

Markdown has a few implementations. Buttondown starts from [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown), and we add a handful of extensions & tools to make your editing experience even better.
