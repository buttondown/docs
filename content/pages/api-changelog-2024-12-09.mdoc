When we [added support for filtering subscribers by IP address](https://docs.buttondown.com/api-changelog-2024-12-05), many of you wrote in asking for the same feature for referrer URLs. We've added support for this, too, and you can now filter subscribers by referrer URL:

{% generatedMultilanguageSnippets
   method="GET"
   endpoint="/subscribers"
   query="{\"referrer_url\": \"https://example.com\"}" /%}
