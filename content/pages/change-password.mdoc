## Didn't receive a password reset email?
If you don't receive a password reset email, this might be an indication that the account was created using SSO. Try [logging in](https://buttondown.com/login) using Apple or Google to authenticate.

If you're still unable to log in, please [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) and we'll be happy to help!
