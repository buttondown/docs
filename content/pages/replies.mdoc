  Buttondown offers more sophisticated ways to manage your reader replies.

## Default reply settings
By default, when you send out an email to your subscribers, the email address to which folks can reply is _your_ email address, meaning that any subscriber who hits "reply" on their email client will send an email straight to your email address.

This address is set by the "Email address" field in [Settings â†’ Basics](https://buttondown.com/settings/basics):

## Tracked replies
The default settings are totally fine for most use cases, but sometimes you want to be able to manage replies in a more sophisticated way: maybe you want to track which emails received most replies, or [trigger automations](/automations-introduction) based on who's replying, or forward replies to [other members of your newsletter](/teams). For that, Buttondown offers **tracked replies**.

You can enable tracked replies on a per-newsletter basis in the [Tracking settings page](https://buttondown.com/settings/tracking):

{% iframe src="https://demo.buttondown.com/settings/tracking?emphasis=should_track_replies" /%}

When Tracked replies are enabled, the reply-to address will no longer be your account email. Instead, it will use the following format: `replies+BIG-LONG-ID-NUMBER@buttondown.email`. 

The reply will still be forwarded to your account email, so you won't miss a single comment!
