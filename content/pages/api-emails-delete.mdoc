Delete an email from your Buttondown account. Deleting an email will:

- Remove the email from your archive (if it was published)
- Scrub any references to the email from related emails
- Delete any associated comments, social mentions, and other related data
- Cancel any scheduled sends associated with the email

Note that deleted emails cannot be recovered, so be sure this is what you want to do before proceeding.
