When [creating an export of your Buttondown data](/api-exports-create), you can now specify two new fields to transform the shape and specificity of the data you receive:

- `parameters`: a dictionary of parameters to filter the data you receive.
- `columns`: a list of columns to include in the export.

Rather than just getting "every data point about every subscriber, ever":

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.buttondown.com/v1/exports \
     --header "Authorization: Token <your-api-key>" \
     --data '{"collections": ["subscribers"]}'
```

You can, say, grab _just the email address and status_ of _every subscriber in the past week_:

```shell
curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.buttondown.com/v1/exports \
     --header "Authorization: Token <your-api-key>" \
     --data '{"collections": ["subscribers"], "parameters": {"date": ["2024-12-03", null]}, "columns": ["email", "subscriber_type"]}'
```

(We plan on augmenting this functionality to allow pulling _specific_ metadata fields, too, but you can't do that quite yet.)
