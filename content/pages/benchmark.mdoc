Export your Benchmark contacts by following the procedure in [Benchmark's documentation](https://kb.benchmarkemail.com/en/How-do-I-export-my-Contact-List/).

### Importing your archives (or email campaigns)

According to Benchmark (as of November 2021), "_You can only print the email campaigns as a PDF. Unfortunately, you can not export them." "You have to go in every campaign individually to print them as PDF."_

You can save or print your email campaigns as PDFs by following the instructions in [Benchmark's documentation](https://kb.benchmarkemail.com/en/is-it-possible-to-print-my-campaign/). [Contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) and we’ll help you with importing those PDFs.

### You did it!

After you finish the process documented above, Buttondown will begin an audit and migration process to make sure everything is in order. After that completes, you should be safe to disable or deactivate your Benchmark account.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do subscribers need to re-enter their credit card?

Yes. Benchmark uses Paypal to process payments. Buttondown uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) as its payments processor. Unfortunately, it's not possible to transfer payment information for your Benchmark subscribers over to Buttondown.
