By going to the very first setting under your settings page, you can change your newsletter's username.

## What happens to old URLs and links when I change my username?

Let's say you change your username from `telemachus` to `telly-weekly`. If you had an old email accessible under `https://buttondown.com/telemachus/archive/my-chompies`, that URL will _not_ continue to work: Buttondown does not automatically redirect old URLs to the new username, for security reasons. However, we _do_ have this functionality hidden behind some internal tooling, so feel free to [contact us](https://buttondown.com/support) if you want us to flag it for you.
