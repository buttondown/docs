Buttondown offers an opt-out feature available at all billing plans called the Portal, which lets your subscribers change their email address, view their invoices, settings, and unsubscribe or resubscribe to their newsletter. It also gives them an easy way to quickly access this information without having to reach out to you directly. 

## Accessing the Portal

Subscribers can access the Portal in a few places:

1. It's automatically added to the footer of your emails if Portal is enabled.
2. You can inject it anywhere using the [`manage_subscription_url` template variable](/template-variables#manage_subscription_url).
3. Buttondown's [main login page](https://buttondown.com/login).

## Turning off the portal

To turn the setting off, go to [Settings > Features > Portal](https://buttondown.com/settings/portal):

## What data is available in the Portal?

The forms displayed in the subscriber management page are the same as the forms you use to subscribe people to your list: [subscribe form inputs](/building-your-subscriber-base#adding-metadata-to-your-subscribers). By default,
these inputs only change a subscriber's metadata â€” but, combined with [tags](/tags) and [automations](/automations-introduction), you can use them to give subscribers the ability to change their tags, too.

For simple cases, all you'll need to do is make sure to check the "Automatically tag?" input when creating a new Subscribe form input; this will ensure that, when a subscriber changes their metadata, the corresponding tags will change as well.

Some caveats:

- It is not currently possible to only allow _some_ subscribe form inputs to be changed by subscribers. If you enable Portal, all fields will be editable.
- At the moment, the only possible inputs you can vend to your subscribers are "free text", "select", and "checkbox". Support for other input types is planned in the near future.

### How checkboxes work

Checkbox type form inputs create a metadata field that holds two potential string values. You'll need to reference these string values in two different automations for full subscriber autonomy:

| Scenario                                                                 | Value                |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Subscriber checks a box in the Portal or initial subscription | `True` (capitalized) |
| Subscriber unchecks a box in the Portal                    | `False` (capitalized)|

### Didn't this used to be called "subscriber autonomy"?

Yes, it sure did.
