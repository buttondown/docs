A temporary failure (also called a "soft bounce") is when delivery is temporarily unavailable.

 There are a number of different reasons that you may see a temporary failure: a mail server going down briefly, a subscriber's inbox being full, or a message has been blocked by spam filters. We've listed a couple of the more esoteric ones below:

| Reason | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Message delayed | The message was delayed because the recipient's mail server or _our_ mail server was busy. |
| Soft bounce | The recipient's mail server could not accept the message at the moment, but it may accept it later. |
| ISP block | The recipient's email provider (such as Gmail or Apple mail) has blocked this specific message from being delivered. |

In general, Buttondown will retry messages that have temporarily failed; you don't need to do anything.

If Buttondown receives three consecutive temporary failures from a subscriber without any successful deliveries, we will mark them as undeliverable.
