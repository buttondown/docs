Test mode is a feature that allows you to send all newsletter emails to yourself instead of your actual subscribers. This is useful for testing email layouts, checking how emails render across different clients, or previewing how your newsletter will look before sending it to your full list.

## How test mode works

When test mode is enabled:

1. **All emails are redirected to you** - Instead of going to your subscribers, emails will be sent to your newsletter's primary email address
2. **Headers show the intended recipient** - Each email includes a clear header showing who would have received the email
3. **Subject lines are prefixed** - Email subjects will include `[TEST MODE]` to help you identify test emails
4. **Everything else works normally** - All other email features (tracking, templating, etc.) work as usual

## Enabling test mode

To enable test mode for your newsletter:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Danger Zone**
2. Find the **Test mode** section
3. Click **Enable test mode**

## What test mode looks like

When you receive a test mode email, you'll see:

### In the email header
A prominent red banner at the top of the email showing:
- "⚠️ TEST MODE ENABLED"
- The email address of the subscriber who would have received it
- A reminder to disable test mode

### In the subject line
Your email subject will be prefixed with `[TEST MODE]` to help you identify test emails in your inbox.

### In plain text emails
Test mode emails include a header section showing the same information as the HTML version.

## Common use cases

Test mode is particularly useful for:

- **Testing new email templates** - See how your custom templates render before sending
- **Checking personalization** - Verify that template variables and personalization work correctly
- **Testing automations** - Ensure automated emails look and behave as expected
- **Quality assurance** - Review emails before important campaigns
- **Training new team members** - Let them practice without risk of sending to real subscribers

## Limitations

- Test mode affects **all** emails from your newsletter, including automations
- You cannot selectively test individual emails while others send normally
- Test emails still count toward your monthly email limit
- Email analytics (opens, clicks) will reflect your own interactions, not real subscriber behavior

## Best practices

1. **Always double-check** - Before sending important emails, verify that test mode is disabled
2. **Use draft previews first** - For simple previews, use the draft preview feature instead
3. **Test with different subscriber types** - Send test emails to different subscriber segments to verify personalization
4. **Document your testing** - Keep notes on what you tested and any issues found
