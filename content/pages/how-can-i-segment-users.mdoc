  Buttondown allows you to segment your audience using tags, metadata, or by creating a new newsletter.

Buttondown has three ways of segmenting subscribers who might want to receive different content:

- Using one newsletter, but having subscribers [tagged](/tags) into different groups
- Using one newsletter, but searching [metadata](/metadata) for a particular value 
- Creating [multiple separate newsletters](/multiple-newsletters)
