Buttondown allows you to set up both monthly and yearly payment options for your newsletter.

In order to give your subscribers the option to choose between monthly and yearly, you need to do a small amount of setup in Stripe:

1. Log in to your [Stripe dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com), using the account that you connected to Buttondown.
1. On the sidebar, navigate to "Product catalog".
1. Select the Stripe Product that you use with Buttondown.
1. Select the *monthly* price.
1. Scroll down to the Upsell section and select your *yearly* price.

Now, when checking out on your monthly price, subscribers will see the option to switch to yearly:
