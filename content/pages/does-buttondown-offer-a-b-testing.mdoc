title: Does Buttondown offer A/B testing?
description:  >-
  Buttondown does not formally offer A/B testing, but we have some options to achieve something similar.

Not at this time, no, though you do have two options to approximate A/B testing:

- **Tag-based A/B testing**: You can create two separate tags and send two different emails to each tag, and then compare the difference in open rates, click rates, etc.
- **`random_number` merge tag**: You can use the `random_number` merge tag to randomly assign a percentage of your subscribers to one of two groups, and then send two different emails to each group. Check out the [random_number](template-variables#random_number) documentation for more information.
