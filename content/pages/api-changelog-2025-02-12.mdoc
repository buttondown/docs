We've added the ability to filter emails by subject!

Now, when you [list emails](/api-emails-list), you can pass in an optional `subject` parameter in the query to grab just the emails that match that. This parameter is substring-based (so "Hello" will match "Hello world", for example) and case-insensitive.
