The Buttondown Bookmarklet is a browser tool that lets you quickly save interesting links to a draft email in your Buttondown account. It's perfect for curating content for link roundups, newsletters, or keeping track of articles you want to share with your subscribers.

## Features

- **One-click saving**: Save any webpage to your Buttondown drafts with a single click
- **Add notes**: Include your thoughts or context about each link
- **Automatic draft creation**: Creates a "Bookmarked items" draft if one doesn't exist
- **Works everywhere**: Compatible with any website and modern browser
- **Secure OAuth authentication**: No API keys needed - uses secure OAuth flow

## Using the bookmarklet

When you find an interesting link:

1. **Click the bookmarklet** in your bookmarks bar
2. **Review the link details** in the popup modal
3. **Add notes** (optional) about why this link is interesting
4. **Click "Save Link"** to add it to your draft

The link will be added to a draft email called "Bookmarked items" in your Buttondown account.

## How links are formatted

Links are saved in Markdown format:

{% playgroundEmbed initialContent="- [Article Title](https://example.com/article) - Your optional notes here\n- [Another Article](https://example.com/another-article) - Another note" /%}

Each new link is appended to the existing draft, creating a running list of your bookmarked items.

### Finding your draft

Look for an email draft titled "Bookmarked items" in your Buttondown dashboard. This draft is created automatically the first time you use the bookmarklet.

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication issues

- Make sure popups are allowed for buttondown.com
- Try signing out and back in to Buttondown
