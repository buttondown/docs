Buttondown's Markdown rendering engine is [Python-Markdown](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown). Some details about the gnarly implementation below: feel free to ignore this unless you're a Buttondown (and/or Markdown) power user!

### Extensions

In addition, Buttondown uses a handful of extensions:

- [smarty](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/smarty/), to convert ASCII characters into HTML entities
- [tables](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/tables/), to allow basic tables
- [footnotes](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/footnotes/), to allow basic footnotes. (These are rendered in your online archives using [littlefoot.js](https://littlefoot.js.org/))
- [fenced_code](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/fenced_code_blocks/), to allow a more common approach for embedding code snippets
- [pymdownx.tilde](https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions/extensions/tilde/), for allowing of deletions and subscripts
- [CodeHilite](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/code_hilite/), for syntax highlighting of code snippets

### Embeds

In addition to all of *those*, Buttondown uses some proprietary extensions for embedding things like tweets, YouTube videos, and gifs â€” but none of these should affect your general rendering experience.

Embeds can be invoked by putting the URL of the resource (Tweet, post, image, etc.) on its own line. *Only* the URL should be on the line. Any additional whitespace or characters will intercept the magic of embeds.

Embeds support URLs from the following sources:

- [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com)
- [Gist](https://gist.github.com)
- [Giphy](https://giphy.com/)
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com)
- [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home)
- [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com)
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)

Play around with it!

#### Escaping

Embeds only trigger on their own self-contained lines. If you're looking for an escape hatch out of these embeds, you can simply wrap the link in an HTML tag, like so:


{% preview before="Here is a tweet I liked!\n\n<div>https://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321</div>"
            after="Here is a tweet I liked!\nhttps://twitter.com/rachsyme/status/1352057677359288321" /%}

### Tables of contents

If you're interested in creating a table of contents in your Buttondown newsletter, be sure to use *names* (such as `<a name='heading'>`) rather than *ids* (such as `<a id='heading'>`)! Gmail and many other email clients strip `id` tags from emails, which will break internal links.
