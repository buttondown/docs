### Reaching the free tier's cap

Buttondown is free for your **first hundred subscribers** and requires a small monthly fee for more than that, because sending emails and running servers ain't cheap! (You can read more on our [pricing page](https://buttondown.com/pricing).)

That being said, it would be awful if you suddenly hit a hundred subscribers and didn't have a chance to register a credit card and so additional subscribers would be shown the door â€” that doesn't happen! You can continue to accrue subscribers past a hundred, you just can't send any emails to them until you fill out your [billing information](https://buttondown.com/settings).
