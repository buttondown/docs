## Overview

Mantine is a React component library that lets you build web applications. You can add a subscription form to your newsletter to your Mantine application.

## Getting started

To use the examples below, you'll need to install `@mantine/core` and `@mantine/form`:

```bash
pnpm install @mantine/core @mantine/form
```

You'll notice two things:

1. We use "Uncontrolled mode" when building this form. This means that rather than storing form state within React proper, we manage state in a ref for performance reasons. This is not the _biggest_ deal in the world either way, since this form is small, but it's still better.
2. We do use `mantine`'s built-in form validations, but Buttondown also has its own suite of validations that we use to ensure all incoming subscribers are valid.
