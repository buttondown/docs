When you can write a newsletter email using a subscriber's first name, it can give a friendly, personal feeling to your words. If you’ve ever received an email that starts with “Dear [Your Name Here]” as opposed to “Dear Reader,” it’s likely that there was a mail merge or substitution string involved—and those mail merges and substitution strings rely on [metadata](/metadata) to work properly.

Read on to learn about how you, too, can collect and use metadata to personalize your newsletter!

## Collecting subscriber names

By default, Buttondown’s subscription forms only collect subscribers’ email addresses. Without any adjustments, your subscription form will look something like this.

   variant="subscriber" /%}

But with a few customizations, you can use Buttondown's subscription forms to ask subscribers for their names, the names of the companies they work for, their interests, or any other facts that might be useful for your newsletter!

### Customize your subscription form

You can also use Buttondown's [subscriber autonomy](/subscriber-autonomy) feature to collect metadata from your subscribers when they first subscribe.

### Add metadata manually

Prefer to go the manual route for updating your subscribers’ metadata? Go ahead and add your input key and value in the “Metadata” section of your subscriber’s “Notes” page. Here's how:

1. Navigate to ["Subscribers"](https://buttondown.com/subscribers) and find the subscriber whose metadata you wish to view.
1. Click the three-dot **overflow** menu and choose **Notes**. The subscriber's "Notes" page appears.
1. Scroll to the "Metadata" section and click **Add**. A key/value field opens.
1. Specify a key and value, such as "first_name" and "John".
1. Click **Add another** to add more metadata, or click **Save changes**.

### Update metadata through Buttondown’s API

Want to add metadata to an existing subscriber using our [API](/api-subscribers-introduction)? Copy the code below and plug in your subscriber ID (which you can find in the subscriber’s “Notes”), as well as your personal API key (which you can find in the “API” section of your Buttondown [settings](https://buttondown.com/requests)). Then add your input key and its corresponding value.

{% generatedMultilanguageSnippets
   method="PATCH"
   endpoint="/subscribers/{id}"
   body="{\"metadata\": {\"first_name\": \"John\"}}" /%}

Run this code, and the metadata in your subscriber “Notes” should be updated and ready to go.

## Using Subscriber Names

### Send personalized emails

Instead of addressing emails one at a time, you can address them automatically using Buttondown’s `{{ subscriber.metadata }}` [template variable](/template-variables). By plugging your “first_name” key into this template variable, you'll direct Buttondown to retrieve each subscriber’s first name for you!

   initialContent="Hello {{subscriber.metadata.first_name}}!"
   height="600px"
   title="Using metadata in your email"
   editorMode="plaintext" /%}

But wait! What if you don’t have first names for every subscriber? Then it’s time to break out our “If / Else” template. This lets Buttondown choose between using a first name, if one is available, and a placeholder name if not. Check out the example below.

{% playgroundEmbed
   initialContent="Hello {% if subscriber.metadata.name %}{{subscriber.metadata.name}}{% else %}Pikachu{% endif %}!"
   height="600px"
   title="Fallback for missing metadata"
   editorMode="plaintext" /%}
