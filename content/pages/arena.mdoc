## Overview

Buttondown lets you connect your Are.na account to your newsletter. This uses our [automations](/automations-introduction) feature to automatically share your newsletters to your Are.na channels.

## Set up the Are.na integration

Here's how to connect your Are.na account to Buttondown:

1. In Buttondown, navigate to **Settings** and click [Integrations](https://buttondown.com/settings/integrations).
1. Find the "Are.na" integration option and click **Connect**. Are.na opens.
1. Authorize Buttondown to post to your channels.

After you connect your Are.na account, a "Connected to Are.na" message displays on the Integrations page.

## Share your newsletters to Are.na

To share your newsletters to Are.na, you can create an automation that posts your newsletters to an Are.na channel whenever you send them. To do this, create a new [Automation](https://buttondown.com/automations/new), or just click the Automation banner below:

{% automation
   name="Automatically post to Are.na"
   description="This automation will automatically post new emails onto Are.na"
   trigger="When an email is sent"
   url="https://buttondown.com/automations/new?trigger=email.sent&action=create_arena_post&name=Automatically+post+to+arena"
   action="Post on Are.na" /%}

The simplest and most common use case is to create an automation that posts your newsletters to an Are.na channel whenever you send them. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page and click **New**. The "New automation" panel opens.
1. (Optional) Give your automation a human-readable "Name."
1. Set the **Trigger** to [when an email is sent](/api-webhooks-event-types#email.sent).
1. Set the **Action** to [Create an Are.na post](/automation-actions#create_arena_post).
1. Enter your Are.na channel slug in the "Channel slug" field.
1. (Optional) Customize the message content. If you leave this blank, Buttondown will use the email content and URL.
1. Click **Save changes**.

To enable the new automation, either click **Unpause** in the automation panel, or click to enable the automation's toggle in the [**Automations**](https://buttondown.com/automations) page.

## Frequently asked questions

### How do I find my Are.na channel slug?

Your channel slug is the part of the URL after your username. For example, in `https://www.are.na/buttondown/mood-vy0yu8sp4ba`, the channel slug is `mood-vy0yu8sp4ba`.

### Can I dynamically customize the contents of the post?

Yes, through [template variables](/template-variables)! These variables are supported:

- `email`
- sub-variables of `email` (`email.subject`, etc)
- `email_url`

### What kind of content can I share on Are.na?

Are.na supports both text and links. When you share your newsletter via the automation, it will be posted as text content along with a link to your newsletter.
