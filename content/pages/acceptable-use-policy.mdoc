Buttondown's default stance is to support all content so long as it is not harassing, harmful or otherwise damaging. That said, we're also aware of the impact that some content can have on communities both on and offline.

We're lucky that most all of our customers are really thoughtful about what they share! But there are occasions when we have to offboard customers for content issues.

We hope that this document helps clarify the types of content that's prohibited from being published on Buttondown.

## Prohibited content

This includes (but is not limited to) newsletters that are:

To enforce this, we require that all subscribers [double opt-in](/glossary-double-optin) to receiving your newsletter.

- Pretending to be an employee or representative of a company
- Linking to malicious sites
- Attempting to gather personal information through deceptive or misleading means

### SEO backlinking, and link farms
