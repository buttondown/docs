Buttondown has a built-in [WYSIWYG](/glossary-wysiwyg) editor (in addition to the [markdown editor](/using-markdown)) that allows you to view and edit your emails in a way that resembles how they will be formatted when they are sent.


## Built-in components
Fancy mode comes with a variety of different built-in components. To view the different options, use the toolbar at the top of the editor or type "/" on a new line.

### Images
You can either upload your own image or use a stock photo from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).

#### Using Unsplash
Buttondown has a built-in Unsplash integration, allowing you to search & embed high-quality images without leaving the app.

To search for images on Unsplash, click `Find image on Unsplash` using the slash menu and a modal will pop up. Search for the image that you want and click on it for it to be added to your email.

See a more detailed guide [here](/uploading-images#fancy-mode).

### Emojis

Emojis are fully supported in the editor.

Not sure which emoji to use? Simply type a colon (":") followed by a word describing the emoji (e.g., "happy") to see some suggestions.

### Block quote

**Shortcut**: You can add a block quote by typing `>` followed by a space.

### Pull quote
Text inside a pull quote is italicized and centered, as opposed to a block quote.

### Table

Tables are a great way to display data in a structured format. Buttondown formats tables with a subtle border by default, but you can also remove that border if you're using a table for a design element to align items horizontally.

### Poetry block
Use a poetry block if you want the text to maintain its spacing when it is published.

### Code block

Code blocks are automatically syntax highlighted based on the programming language.

**Shortcut**: type 3 backticks followed by the programming language and press enter (for example: \`\`\`python).

### Footnote
Adding a footnote will add 2 things in the editor:
- a footnote reference
- a footnote at the bottom of the editor

**Note**: when you delete a footnote reference, the corresponding footnote will also be deleted.

**Shortcut**: add a footnote by typing [^text], "text" being any string sequence.

### LaTeX block
A [LaTeX](/glossary-latex) block allows you to write & render LaTeX content inside the editor. (Note that as of now, LaTeX is only renderable as a "block", and not inline with text.)

**Shortcut**: add a LaTeX block by typing your expression inside two dollar signs ($$) and pressing space/enter.

### Divider
A divider is a horizontal line that sits between 2 pieces of content.

**Shortcut**: add a divider by typing 3 dashes or underscores & pressing space/enter.

### Webwall
A webwall enables you to add content that will only be displayed on the web. Any content below the webwall will not be included in the email sent to email clients.

A subscription button is a [CTA button](/glossary-cta) that links to your [newsletter's URL](/building-your-subscriber-base#sharing-your-buttondown-url), allowing people to subscribe to your newsletter there.

- "Premium-only" blocks are only displayed to premium subscribers.
