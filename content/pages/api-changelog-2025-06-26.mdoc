description: "Added `product` to `StripeSubscription`"
---

We've added a `product` field to the `StripeSubscription` schema. This field is the name of the product which the subscriber is subscribed to. (You can override this by setting the `buttondown_template_facing_id` metadata on the product in Stripe.)
