{% paidFeature feature="comments" /%}

Buttondown's built-in comment feature gives your readers a place to talk with each other and stay connected with you.

Comments slot nicely into the bottom of your newsletter. Plus you can build around them just like you would any other part of your newsletter: filter and store them through the API, set up webhooks to plug comments into downstream services, or fire up an automation to send special content to your biggest fans.

What's more, comments are a great way to improve your newsletter's SEO — search engines love fresh, user-generated content, and we make sure your comments are indexed and searchable through [JSON-LD](/glossary-developers#json-ld) metadata. (We also use [rel tags](/glossary-writing-emails#ugc) to mark links as user-generated content to make sure your subscribers' content helps out your search engine rankings, too.)
