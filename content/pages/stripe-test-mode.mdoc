title: Can I use Stripe Test mode with Buttondown?
navigationTitle: Test mode

Buttondown does not currently support Stripe's [test mode](https://stripe.com/docs/test-mode), which lets you test your integration without charging a credit card.

To test your integration, we recommend charging a small amount on a real credit card and then refunding the charge. This will cost a few cents for each transaction.
