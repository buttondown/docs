## Update your email's description

Whether you want to call it a [preheader](/glossary-preheader) or a subtitle or a subhead or just a _description_, you can change it in the **Metadata** drawer:

1. Open the email that you wish to change the description for.
2. Click on **Details** located in the bottom. A drawer will appear.
3. Navigate to the **Metadata** section, and expand it.
4. There should be a field for changing the description, change it to your desired description.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Save**.

## Update your email's URL slug

Each email has a unique URL [slug](/glossary-slug). For large websites or long-running email newsletters, the slug can be the only thing that differentiates one page from another. You can change the slug of any email in your Buttondown newsletter, including ones you've already sent. Don't worry about breaking any links that use the old slug--Buttondown keeps track of historical slugs for each email and redirects readers who use the old link so they end up in the right place.

Here's how to update your URL slug:

1. Open the email that you wish to change the slug for.
2. Click on **Details** located in the bottom. A drawer will appear.
3. Navigate to the **Web Archive** section, and expand it.
4. There should be a field for changing URL slugs, change it to your desired slug.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Save**

## Update your email's issue number

Buttondown automatically assigns the number `1` to the first newsletter email you publish. Every email you publish afterwards will increment its issue number by 1. But if you have imported the archives of an existing newsletter from another system to Buttondown, Buttondown's numbering might not be correct. If you need to, you can manually edit issue numbers in your Archive page.

Buttondown respects existing issue numbers and always increments one number greater than the largest issue number. If you change your most recent email to the number you want, Buttondown will number emails correctly after that.

You can disable issue numbers completely by signing up for either a [Standard or Professional plan](https://buttondown.com/pricing).

To edit your issue numbers:

1. Open the email that you wish to change the slug for.
2. Click on **Details** located in the bottom. A drawer will appear.
3. Navigate to the **Web Archive** section, and expand it.
4. There should be a field for changing issue numbers, change it to your desire.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click on **Save**

## Add share links to your email

You can add social media sharing options to your newsletter by customizing the [Social](https://buttondown.com/settings/design) section of your account. Find sharing options in the "Suggested sharing options" section. Buttondown supports most large social media and networking platforms.

Alternatively, you can add share links to your email by customizing your newsletter's footer in the [Settings](https://buttondown.com/settings) page.

Then, you can add custom Markdown links using some template variables that Buttondown assigns you. Here's an example:

```markdown
If you liked this email, please share it:

- on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url={{email_link}}&text={{email.subject}})
- on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u={{email_url}})
- on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url={{email_url}})
```
