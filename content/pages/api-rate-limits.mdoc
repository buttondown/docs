description: General information about rate limits in the Buttondown API.
---

Buttondown does not have blanket rate limits on the API, but we do have some specific ones:

| Endpoint | Rate limit |
|----------|-----------|
| [`POST /v1/subscribers`](/api-subscribers-create) | 100 requests per hour |

At this moment, we do not surface rate limit information via API headers; you'll want to check the response body for an explicit error message.
