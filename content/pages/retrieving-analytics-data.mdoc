{% noticeInfo text="This guide assumes a familiarity with REST APIs" /%}


Want to know how your last email performed? The [analytics modal](https://buttondown.com/features/analytics) in the Buttondown dashboard makes it easy to see emails stats like deliveries, failures, open rates, click through rates.

But there might be times when you'd like to do something a bit more complex. Maybe you need to pull data into another tool programmatically, or build a custom dashboard. For projects like this, look no further than the Buttondown API!

## Setup
Before you can use analytics, you'll need to enable Tracking in your [Buttondown settings](https://buttondown.com/settings/tracking). If Tracking is not enabled, the request will still be successful but will not return any data.


## Retrieving email analytics

{% multilanguageSnippets
   python="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/1.py"
   ruby="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/1.rb"
   curl="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/1.sh"
   javascript="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/1.js" /%}

### Parameters

Retrieving analytics only required a single parameter: the email ID.

The email ID can be located by first [listing all emails](/api-emails-list).


### Results
A successful (200) request will return an object with the data for this particular email. For example:

```json
{
    "recipients": 100,
    "deliveries": 99,
    "opens": 50,
    "clicks": 25,
    "temporary_failures": 1,
    "permanent_failures": 2,
    "unsubscriptions": 3,
    "complaints": 1
}
```

You can also visit the [API Requests tab](https://buttondown.com/requests) in your Buttondown dashboard for more details. Here's what this looks like:

{% noticeWarn text="Not seeing the data you expect? Make sure that Tracking is enabled in your Buttondown settings." /%}


## Email events
Now that you have the overall data on how your email performed, you can dig a bit deeper and learn how subscribers interacted with your emails!

You can request more information about each email event by making a request like so: `/events?event_type={event-type}`


### Email event types

_Note: The name in the Analytics response differs from the Event Type name._

| Analytics response  | Event Type | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| recipients |  sent | The email was sent by Buttondown. |
| deliveries |  delivered | The email was accepted by the recepient's email server. |
| opens |  opened | The recipient opened the email. |
| clicks |  clicked | The recipient clicked a link in the email. |
| temporary_failures |  bounced | The recipient's address is invalid, or misconfigured. |
| permanent_failures |  rejected | The email could not be delivered. |
| unsubscriptions | unsubscribed  | The recipient has unsubscribed from the email. |
| complaints |  complained | The recipient [marked the email as spam](/glossary-cfl). |
| replies | replied | The recipient replied to your email. |

For example, if you wanted to learn more about your subscribers who received your newsletter, you could make the following request:

{% multilanguageSnippets
   python="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/2.py"
   ruby="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/2.rb"
   curl="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/2.sh"
   javascript="public/code/retrieving-analytics-data/2.js" /%}


A successful (200) request will would return an array of all subscribers to whom your email was delivered:

```json
   [{
      "id": "ba9fefc2-55e8-4ada-5555-057fe34d5a49",
