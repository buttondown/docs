## Going above and beyond

### Add subscriber tags

As your subscriber base grows, you may want to organize it by assigning tags to individual subscribers. You can use these tags to sort your subscriber base, as well as to send out targeted email blasts.

You can automatically add tags to any new subscribers by modifying the HTML code you used to create your subscription form. All you have to do is add a new <span class="bg-gray-200 font-mono p-0.5 rounded">input</span> tag that matches the following format.

```html
<input type="radio" id="Fettuccine" name="tag" value="Fettuccine" />
<label for="Fettuccine">Fettuccine Alfredo</label>
```

Here's an example of how your HTML code might look with three new tag options.
```html
<form
  action="
    https://buttondown.com/api/emails/
  "
  method="post"
  class="embeddable-buttondown-form"
>
  <label for="email">Email</label>
  <input
    type="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="you@example.com"
  />
  <label for="email">What Is Your Favorite Pasta Dish?</label>
  <br />
  <input type="radio" id="Fettuccine" name="tag" value="Fettuccine" />
  <label for="Fettuccine">Fettuccine Alfredo</label>
  <input type="radio" id="Carbonara" name="tag" value="Carbonara" />
  <label for="Carbonara">Spaghetti Carbonara</label>
  <input type="radio" id="penne" name="tag" value="penner" />
  <label for="penne">Penne alla Vodka</label><br />
  <br />
  <input type="hidden" value="1" name="embed" />
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe" />
  <p>
    <a href="https://buttondown.com" target="_blank">
        Powered by Buttondown.
    </a>
  </p>
</form>
```
Here's what that code looks like when it's rendered.

You can add as many tags as you want. To learn more about tags, read [Building your subscriber base](/building-your-subscriber-base).
