title: Updating a subscriber's automation
endpoint: /subscribers/{id_or_email}/automations/{automation_attempt_id}
method: patch

This endpoint allows you to update an automation attempt for a specific subscriber. Currently, the only supported action is skipping an automation attempt by setting its status to `skipped`.

This is useful when you want to prevent a specific automation from being sent to a subscriber without removing them from the automation entirely.
