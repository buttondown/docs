Buttondown's [Modern](/customizing-email-design#modern-template) email template comes with a section at the top that has the newsletter's name and icon, and the email's subject and publication date.

Some authors want to hide this, so their emails get straight to the writing.

To do this, go to your [email Design settings](https://buttondown.com/settings/design/email) and add the following CSS:

```css
.newsletter-icon, .newsletter-masthead, .email-preamble {
    display: none !important;
}
```
