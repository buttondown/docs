# Email automation

## Building an activation sequence in Buttondown

Unfortunately, you can't right now. I'm working on an [API](https://www.notion.so/API-to-send-specific-extant-email-to-subscriber-ea8c13f6232f4f528bc3aa5017b46e3f) to let you do this, but in the meantime you can only specify a single **welcome email** to new subscribers. You can do this by going to your [settings page](https://buttondown.email/settings):

This is a pretty common request — perhaps the _most_ common feature request I get. I realize that I'm disappointing folks by not supporting it at the moment! The reason I don't is because it's opening a bag of worms. There's no such thing as "just a simple welcome sequence" — as soon as you specify a string of emails, you have to specify arbitrary lengths between those strings, branching logic, tracking, etc. etc. It's a complex feature that I don't think I would be able to build simply and in the style of the rest of the tool.
