# Registration and Setup

Ready to dive into Buttondown? Look no further for everything you need to sign up, configure your settings, and send your first newsletter.

## Getting Ready

Buttondown is entirely based in your browser (nifty, right?). This makes registration quick and easy—but it’ll be even quicker if you have a few things at the ready:

- A browser with cookies, JavaScript, and in-browser pop-ups enabled

- An active email address

- A strong password

Once you’re ready to roll, you can begin by registering [here](https://buttondown.email/register).

## Signing Up

### Choose your username

First thing’s first: You’ll need to think up your username. This username is not only what you’ll use to log in—it’ll also be part of your public Buttondown URL. With this in mind, you may want to pick a username that’s memorable, identifiable, and unique to your newsletter. (Don’t worry, you can change this later if you need to.)

### Add your email

Enter your go-to email for receiving notifications, account updates, and billing information.

Later on, if you decide to send your newsletter from the Buttondown server, your subscribers won’t see the email address that you registered with. Instead, they’ll see a Buttondown email address formatted as “username@mail.buttondown.email.” It’ll look something like this:

![Sample email address if sending from Buttondown server](/images/settings/registration_sample-email-address.png)

You also have the option to send your newsletter from a [custom domain](/getting-started/getting-a-custom-domain). It’s totally up to you, but if you choose to do this, then make sure your email address matches your domain in order to avoid any delivery issues.

### Devise your password

You know the drill—use lots of numbers, letters, and symbols.

Once you’ve completed these three steps, click “Create an Account” and you’ll be well on your way.

## Crafting Your Newsletter's Look and Feel

### Fill out your general newsletter details

Boom, you’re in! After perusing your administrative [settings](https://buttondown.email/settings), scroll down to the “General” section to start shaping your newsletter.

With your username and email taken care of, we can move on to the fun part: Coming up with your newsletter’s name, author, description, and more. This is your time to shine—customize this section however you like! Just three quick things to note:

- What you put in the “Author” field will populate your newsletter’s “From” field

- Your newsletter “Description” can be written in Markdown, HTML, or plaintext

- Your time zone will be used for scheduled newsletter recommendations, as well as for timestamps in your archives

When you’re done filling out the details, your “General” settings should look a little something like this:

### Build out your newsletter's "Scaffolding"

Your “Header” and “Footer” will appear at the top and bottom (respectively) of every newsletter that you send. These fields can be written out in Markdown, HTML, or plaintext.

In this section, you also have the option to customize each newsletter’s CSS, or style, with HTML. You can learn more about building out your newsletter’s CSS [here](/advanced-features/css).

### Establish your newsletter's "Branding"

Your newsletter’s branding includes its color palette, or “Tint Color,” as well as its logo, or “Icon.” Your “Tint Color” will pop up as an accent in places like hyperlinks or your “Subscribe” button. Your “Icon” will appear on top of your newsletters, in your archives, and as part of your social “Share” button. Upload a square image (ideally a PNG) with a 300 x 300 resolution for the best results.

But before that, if you want to build even more, keep reading!

### Build your subscriber base

You’ve sent your first newsletter, and now you’re ready to cultivate your subscriber base. You can start by:
* [Sharing your Buttondown URL](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base#sharing-your-buttondown-url), 
* [Embedding an HTML form](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base#embedding-an-html-form) across your platforms, or 
* [Embedding an iFrame](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base#embedding-an-iframe) on your website. 

### Organize your subscriber base

Want to add more readers to your newsletter? You can use [tags](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base#adding-tags-to-your-subscribers) to sort your subscribers, as well as to send out targeted email blasts. Like tags, [metadata](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base#adding-metadata-to-your-subscribers) can also provide additional context for subscribers. That context can come in handy if you’re searching for a specific set of subscribers.

To learn about these options and more, read [Building Your Subscriber Base](/getting-started/building-your-subscriber-base).

### Use a custom domain

You may choose to send and archive newsletters through a custom domain in order to consolidate your brand presence. Learn more about custom domains by reading [Getting a Custom Domain](/getting-started/getting-a-custom-domain), [Hosting on a Custom Domain](/getting-started/hosting-on-a-custom-domain), and [Sending From a Custom Domain](/getting-started/sending-from-a-custom-domain).

Buttondown is free for your first hundred subscribers. After that, we charge a small fee to help keep the lights on. Pay a visit to [Billing](/getting-started/billing) to explore all of Buttondown’s [pricing options](https://buttondown.email/pricing).
