1. [Log in](https://buttondown.email/login) to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.
2. Your Email address must match your custom sending domain. (If your sending domain is buttondown.xyz, your email has to be name@buttondown.xyz; name@gmail.com won’t work.) Change it if needed.

5. In another tab, go to your DreamHost Control Panel. From the menu on the left, select “Domains” > “Manage Domains”. Click “DNS” under the domain name you are setting up with Buttondown.

6. Add the TXT record(s) - Follow the steps below for each record that has “TXT” in the “TYPE” column:

   1. Click “Add Record”
   2. Click the “TXT” box.
   3. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".buttondown.xyz" from the "KEY" column.  In DreamHost, paste it in the "Host" field. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In DreamHost, paste it in the "TXT Value" field. (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
   5. Click “Add Record”.

7. Add the CNAME records - Follow the steps below for each record that has “CNAME” in the “TYPE” column:

   1. Click “Add Record”
   2. Click the “CNAME” box.
   3. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".buttondown.xyz" from the "KEY" column.  In DreamHost, paste it in the "Host" field. (Pink arrow on the left in screenshot below.)
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In DreamHost, paste it in the "Points to" field. (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
   5. Click “Add Record”.

8. If it were a pie, you’d wait for it to bake. But it’s computers, so DreamHost can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to go bake a pie.
9. Once your DNS records have finished propagating, click “Check records” in Buttondown. If they all come up with green checkmarks, you’re good to go!




## Troubleshooting


### Did you enter the DNS “KEY” (aka “Host” or “Name”) correctly?

Some registrars want the entire “KEY”, but DreamHost only wants the part before “.buttondown.xyz”. If the “Host”/”Name” field for any of your DNS records in DreamHost ends with “.buttondown.xyz”, remove that part.

### Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) and I'm happy to help!
