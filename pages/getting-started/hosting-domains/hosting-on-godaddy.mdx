5. In another tab, log in to your [GoDaddy Domain Control Center](https://dcc.godaddy.com/domains?showAdvanceListView=true&).  Click the "..." next to the domain name you are setting up with Buttondown (pink circle in screenshot below), and click "Manage DNS" in the dropdown menu (orange circle in screenshot below).

6. Add the CNAME record - Take the information from the Buttondown popup and put it in GoDaddy:

   1. In GoDaddy, click “Add”
   2. In the "Type" dropdown menue, select "CNAME" (Orange arrow on the left in screenshot below)
   3. In Buttondown, copy everything before ".buttondown.xyz" from the "KEY" column.  In GoDaddy, paste it in the "Name" field. (Pink arrow in the middle in screenshot below.)
   4. In Buttondown, copy everything from the "NEEDED" column.  In GoDaddy, paste it in the "Value to" field. (Green arrow on the right in screenshot below.)
   5. Click “Add Record”.

8. If it were tea, you’d wait for it to steep. But it’s computers, so GoDaddy can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to enjoy some tea.

9. Once your DNS records have finished propagating, click “Check records” in your Buttondown tab. If it gives you a green checkmark, you’re good to go!

##  Troubleshooting

### Did you get an HTTPS error when you tried to go to your custom hosting domain?

This is normal and temporary.  Your DNS records are still propogating!

###  Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a> and I'm happy to help!
