1. Log in to your Buttondown account. Click on the menu in the top right corner and select “Your newsletter”.

2. Enter your custom hosting domain.

3.  Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the blue "Update settings" bar.
4. Scroll back up to where you entered your custom hosting domain.  Look for the red alert.  Click on the "Click here" link.

7. Click on the "ADD A RECORD" button. (Red circle on the left in screenshot above.)
8. Take the information from the Buttondown popup and put it in Hover:

    1. Select “CNAME” from the "type" dropdown menu.  (Green arrow on the left in screenshot below.)

    2. Enter the "KEY"" from Buttondown where Hover asks for “HOSTNAME”. (Red arrow in the middle in screenshot below.)

    3. Enter the “NEEDED” from Buttondown where Hover  asks for “TARGET NAME”. (Blue arrow on the right in screenshot below.) 

     4. Click "ADD RECORD".

9. If it were tea, you’d wait for it to steep. But it’s computers, so Hover can take up to 24 hours to process your update. This is a good opportunity to enjoy some tea.

10. Once your DNS records have finished propagating, click “Check records” in Buttondown. If it gives you a green checkmark, you’re good to go!

##  Troubleshooting

### Did you get an HTTPS error when you tried to go to your custom hosting domain?

This is normal and temporary.  Your DNS records are still propogating!

###  Are your DNS records still propagating?

I know setting up DNS records is a pain! If it's been 24 hours and you're still not seeing the records get validated in the way you expect, <a href="mailto:justin@buttondown.email">email me</a> and I'm happy to help!
