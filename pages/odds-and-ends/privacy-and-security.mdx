# Privacy and security

### Why Buttondown requires Javascript on archive pages

No interesting reason, just technical debt! This is something I hope to improve
in the future.

### GDPR compliance

Buttondown is of course fully GDPR compliant. You can read Buttondown's privacy policy [here](https://buttondown.email/privacy) and its cookie policy [here](https://buttondown.email/cookies).

If you're interested in a full data request, please [email me](mailto:justin@buttondown.email).

### Bug bounty

Sadly, Buttondown doesn't have the security budget to offer a bug bounty, _but_ I would be deeply indebted to you for doing so! Please report any vulnerabilities to [justin@buttondown.email](mailto:justin@buttondown.email) — I promise to respond promptly and provide a fix as soon as humanly possible.

Sincere kudos to the following individuals for reporting vulnerabilities:

1. John Bullecer
2. Vivek Modi
3. Filippo Valsorda
4. Iheanyi Ekechukwu

### Turning off link or click tracking

Go to your [account settings page](https://buttondown.email/account) and check the "opt out of analytics" checkbox!:

### Adult content policy

My default stance is to support all content so long as it is not harassing, damaging, or otherwise illegal.

However, _paid newsletters_ are a bit of a different story. Buttondown uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses) to process payments; Stripe has some restrictions on adult content. Specifically, it prohibits:

> Pornography and other obscene materials (including literature, imagery and other media) depicting nudity or explicitly sexual acts; sites offering any sexually-related services such as prostitution, escorts, pay-per view, adult live chat features; sexually oriented items (e.g., adult toys); adult video stores and sexually oriented massage parlors; gentleman's clubs, topless bars, and strip clubs; sexually oriented dating services

Unfortunately, that means things are out of my hands: if you want to send adult content over Buttondown you cannot use its paid subscriptions functionality.

### Financial assistance to writers

No. In the event that I _started_ such a practice, I would publish information about what heuristic I used as well as a full list of writers receiving such assistance.

But I will almost certainly never do this. It is a violation of Buttondown's core ethos, which is that Buttondown is a tool rather than an ecosystem — a piece of software, rather than a platform. It's important to me that people using Buttondown are, at the end of the day, writing _newsletters_, not _Buttondowns_.

## WCAG compliance

Buttondown follows the [compliance checklist as outlined by HHS](https://www.hhs.gov/web/section-508/making-files-accessible/checklist/email-508-checklist/index.html).

If you have any other specific questions regarding Buttondown's accessibility, I'd be happy to answer.
