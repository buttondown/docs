# Funding open-source software

Software sits on the shoulders of giants.

Buttondown is a tool that simply would not exist without the gargantuan effort of many, _many_ open-source projects, the vast majority of which are drastically underfunded relative to the value they provide.

I've committed to donating at least 10% of Buttondown's profits to the software that enables it. This is a relatively low number in absolute terms — I'm certainly not changing anyone's life — but I think it's still important.

(As of June 1, 2021, I'm still looking to donate $95. If I can't identify any relevant projects by the end of the month, I'll bump up existing donations.)

(The final tally: since the start of this initiative, I've donated $5,982 to projects relevant to Buttondown's success. That's not that much, and yet it is much more than many companies ten times as large as Buttondown.)
